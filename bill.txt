It also abolishes various general powers to obtain communications data and
restricts the circumstances in which equipment interference can take place.
(3)
Other protections exist by virtue of the Human Rights Act 1998 and elsewhere
in the law.
(4)
Part 2 and Chapter 1 of Part 6 set out circumstances in which the interception
of communications is lawful and make further provision about the interception
of communications.
(5)
Part 3 and Chapter 2 of Part 6 set out circumstances in which the obtaining of
communications data is lawful and make further provision about the obtaining
of communications data.

(ii) a private telecommunication system, or
(iii) a public postal service,
(b) the interception is carried out in the United Kingdom, and
(c) the person does not have lawful authority to carry out the interception.
But it is not an offence under subsection (1) for a person to intercept a

telecommunication system if the person—
(a) is a person with a right to control the operation or use of the system, or
(b) has the express or implied consent of such a person to carry out the

Kingdom.
(4)
Section 5 contains provision about when a person has lawful authority to carry

Public Prosecutions;
(b) in Northern Ireland, except by or with the consent of the Director of
Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.
Definition of “interception” etc.
Interception in relation to telecommunication systems
(1)
(2)
(3)
For the purposes of this Act, a person intercepts a communication in the course
of its transmission by means of a telecommunication system if, and only if—
(a) the person does a relevant act in relation to the system, and
(b) the effect of the relevant act is to make some or all of the content of the
communication available, at a relevant time, to a person who is not the
sender or intended recipient of the communication.
For the meaning of the “content” of a communication, see section 193(6).
In this section “relevant act”, in relation to a telecommunication system,
means—
(a) modifying, or interfering with, the system or its operation;
(b) monitoring transmissions made by means of the system;
(c) monitoring transmissions made by wireless telegraphy to or from
apparatus that is part of the system.
For the purposes of this section references to modifying a telecommunication
system include references to attaching any apparatus to, or otherwise
modifying or interfering with—
(a) any part of the system, or
(b) any wireless telegraphy apparatus used for making transmissions to or
from apparatus that is part of the system.
(4)
In this section “relevant time”, in relation to a communication transmitted by
means of a telecommunication system, means—
(a) any time while the communication is being transmitted, and
(b) any time when the communication is stored in or by the system
(whether before or after its transmission).
(5)
For the purposes of this section, the cases in which any of the content of a
communication is to be taken to be made available to a person at a relevant
time include any case in which any of the content of the communication is
diverted or recorded at a relevant time so as to be available to a person after
that time.
(6)
In this section—
“wireless telegraphy” and “wireless telegraphy apparatus” have the same
meaning as in the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (see sections 116 and
117 of that Act), and
“interfere”, in relation to wireless telegraphy, has the same meaning as in
that Act (see section 115(3) of that Act).
Interception in relation to postal services
(7)
Section 125(3) of the Postal Services Act 2000 applies for the purposes of
determining for the purposes of this Act whether a postal item is in the course
of its transmission by means of a postal service as it applies for the purposes of
determining for the purposes of that Act whether a postal packet is in course
of transmission by post.
Interception carried out in the United Kingdom
(8)
For the purposes of this Act the interception of a communication is carried out
in the United Kingdom if, and only if—
(a) the relevant act or, in the case of a postal item, the interception is carried
out by conduct within the United Kingdom, and
(b) the communication is intercepted—
(i) in the course of its transmission by means of a public postal
service or public telecommunication system, or
(ii) in the course of its transmission by means of a private
telecommunication system in a case where the sender or
intended recipient of the communication is in the United
Kingdom.
Conduct that is not interception
(1)
References in this Act to the interception of a communication do not include
references to the interception of any communication broadcast for general
reception.
(2)
References in this Act to the interception of a communication in the course of
its transmission by means of a postal service do not include references to—
(a) any conduct that takes place in relation only to so much of the
communication as consists in any postal data comprised in, included as
part of, attached to, or logically associated with a communication
(whether by the sender or otherwise) for the purposes of any postal
service by means of which it is being or may be transmitted, or
(b) any conduct, in connection with conduct falling within paragraph (a),
that gives a person who is neither the sender nor the intended recipient
only so much access to a communication as is necessary for the purpose
of identifying such postal data.
For the meaning of “postal data”, see section 194.
Definition of “lawful authority”
(1)
For the purposes of this Act, a person has lawful authority to carry out an
interception if, and only if—
(a) the interception is carried out in accordance with any of the following—

under Chapter 1 of Part 2,
(ii) a targeted equipment interference warrant under Part 5,
(iii) a bulk interception warrant under Chapter 1 of Part 6, or

purpose of obtaining information or taking possession of any
document or other property, or
(ii) is carried out in accordance with a court order made for that
purpose.
(2)
Conduct which has lawful authority for the purposes of this Act by virtue of
subsection (1)(a) or (b) is to be treated as lawful for all other purposes.
(3)
Any other conduct which—
(a) is carried out in accordance with a warrant under Chapter 1 of Part 2 or

and
(c) the person was not, at the time of the interception, making an attempt
to act in accordance with an interception warrant which might, in the
opinion of the Commissioner, explain the interception.

mutual assistance warrant has been issued under Chapter 1 of Part 2
authorising the making of the request.
In this section—
“EU mutual assistance instrument” means an EU instrument which—
(a) relates to the provision of mutual assistance in connection with,

relevant public authority (within the meaning of Part 3).
(3)
A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable—
(a) on summary conviction in England and Wales—

on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
2 years or to a fine, or both.
Abolition of powers to obtain communications data
Abolition of certain powers to obtain data
(1)
(2)
Schedule 2 (which repeals certain general information powers so far as they
enable public authorities to secure the disclosure by a telecommunications
operator or postal operator of communications data without the consent of the
operator) has effect.
Any general information power which—
(a) would (apart from this subsection) enable a public authority to secure
the disclosure by a telecommunications operator or postal operator of
communications data without the consent of the operator, and
(b) does not involve a court order or other judicial authorisation or warrant
and is not a regulatory power,
is to be read as not enabling the public authority to secure such a disclosure.
(3)
A regulatory power which enables a public authority to secure the disclosure
by a telecommunications operator or postal operator of communications data
without the consent of the operator may only be exercised by the public
authority if it is not possible for the authority to use a power under this Act to
secure the disclosure of the data.
(4)
The Secretary of State may by regulations modify any enactment in
consequence of subsection (2).
(5)
In this section “general information power” means—
(a) in relation to disclosure by a telecommunications operator, any power
to obtain information or documents (however expressed) which—
(i) is conferred by or under an enactment other than this Act or the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, and
(ii) does not deal (whether alone or with other matters) specifically
with telecommunications operators or any class of
telecommunications operators, and
(b) in relation to disclosure by a postal operator, any power to obtain
information or documents (however expressed) which—
(i) is conferred by or under an enactment other than this Act or the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, and
(ii) does not deal (whether alone or with other matters) specifically
with postal operators or any class of postal operators.
(6)
In this section—
“power” includes part of a power;
“regulatory power” means any general information power to obtain
information or documents for the purpose of exercising regulatory
functions in relation to telecommunications services or postal services,
and references to powers include duties (and references to enabling are
accordingly to be read as including references to requiring).
Restrictions on interference with equipment
Mandatory use of targeted equipment interference warrants
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
A relevant service may not, for the purpose of facilitating the obtaining of
communications, private information or equipment data, engage in conduct
that could be authorised by a targeted equipment interference warrant or a
bulk equipment interference warrant except under the authority of such a
warrant if—
(a) the service considers that the conduct would (unless done under lawful
authority) constitute one or more offences under sections 1 to 3A of the
Computer Misuse Act 1990 (computer misuse offences), and
(b) there is a British Islands connection.
For the purpose of this section, there is a British Islands connection if—
(a) any of the conduct would take place in the British Islands (regardless of
the location of the equipment that would, or may, be interfered with),
(b) the service believes that any of the equipment that would, or may, be
interfered with would, or may, be in the British Islands at some time
while the interference is taking place, or
(c) a purpose of the interference is to facilitate the obtaining of—
(i) communications sent by, or to, a person who is, or whom the
intelligence service believes to be, for the time being in the
British Islands, or
(ii) private information relating to an individual who is, or whom
the intelligence service believes to be, for the time being in the
British Islands.
This section does not restrict the ability of a relevant service to apply for a
targeted equipment interference warrant or a bulk equipment interference
warrant in cases where—
(a) the service does not consider that the conduct for which it is seeking
authorisation would (unless done under lawful authority) constitute
one or more offences under sections 1 to 3A of the Computer Misuse
Act 1990, or
(b) there is no British Islands connection.
In this section, “relevant service” means—
(a) the Security Service;
(b) the Secret Intelligence Service;
(c) GCHQ;
(d) the Ministry of Defence.
Restriction on use of section 93 of the Police Act 1997
A person may not, for the purpose of facilitating the obtaining of
communications, information or equipment data, make an application under
section 93 of the Police Act 1997 for authorisation to engage in conduct that
could be authorised by a targeted equipment interference warrant if the
applicant considers that the conduct would (unless done under lawful
authority) constitute one or more offences under sections 1 to 3A of the
Computer Misuse Act 1990 (computer misuse offences).

obtained under a bulk interception warrant.
For provision about bulk interception warrants, see Chapter 1 of Part 6.
(4)
A mutual assistance warrant is a warrant which authorises or requires the
person to whom it is addressed to secure, by any conduct described in the
warrant, any one or more of the following—
(a) the making of a request, in accordance with an EU mutual assistance
instrument or an international mutual assistance agreement, for the
provision of any assistance of a kind described in the warrant in
connection with, or in the form of, an interception of communications;
(b) the provision to the competent authorities of a country or territory
outside the United Kingdom, in accordance with such an instrument or
agreement, of any assistance of a kind described in the warrant in
connection with, or in the form of, an interception of communications;

intercepted material or related communications data obtained under
the warrant to the person to whom the warrant is addressed or to any

expressly authorised or required by the warrant, including—
(i) the interception of communications not described in the
warrant, and

PART 3
AUTHORISATIONS FOR OBTAINING COMMUNICATIONS DATA
Targeted authorisations for obtaining data
Power to grant authorisations
(1)
(2)
Subsection (2) applies if a designated senior officer of a relevant public
authority considers—
(a) that it is necessary to obtain communications data for a purpose falling
within subsection (7),
(b) that it is necessary to obtain the data—
(i) for the purposes of a specific investigation or a specific
operation, or
(ii) for the purposes of testing, maintaining or developing
equipment, systems or other capabilities relating to the
availability or obtaining of communications data, and
(c) that the conduct authorised by the authorisation is proportionate to
what is sought to be achieved.
The designated senior officer may authorise any officer of the authority to
engage in any conduct which—
(a)
(b)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
is for the purpose of obtaining the data from any person, and
relates to—
(i) a telecommunication system, or
(ii) data derived from a telecommunication system.
Subsections (1) and (2) are subject to—
(a) section 47 (additional restrictions on grant of authorisations),
(b) sections 54 and 57 to 59 and Schedule 4 (restrictions relating to certain
relevant public authorities),
(c) section 60 (requirement to consult a single point of contact), and
(d) section 61 (Commissioner approval for authorisations to identify or
confirm journalistic sources).
Authorised conduct may, in particular, consist of an authorised officer—
(a) obtaining the communications data themselves from any person or
telecommunication system,
(b) asking any person whom the authorised officer believes is, or may be,
in possession of the communications data to disclose it to a person
identified by, or in accordance with, the authorisation,
(c) asking any person whom the authorised officer believes is not in
possession of the communications data but is capable of obtaining it, to
obtain it and disclose it to a person identified by, or in accordance with,
the authorisation, or
(d) requiring by notice a telecommunications operator—
(i) whom the authorised officer believes is, or may be, in
possession of the communications data to disclose the data to a
person identified by, or in accordance with, the authorisation,
or
(ii) whom the authorised officer believes is not in possession of the
communications data but is capable of obtaining the data, to
obtain it and disclose it to a person identified by, or in
accordance with, the authorisation.
An authorisation—
(a) may relate to data whether or not in existence at the time of the
authorisation,
(b) may authorise the obtaining or disclosure of data by a person who is
not an authorised officer, or any other conduct by such a person, which
enables or facilitates the obtaining of the communications data
concerned, and
(c) may, in particular, require a telecommunications operator who controls
or provides a telecommunication system to obtain or disclose data
relating to the use of a telecommunications service provided by another
telecommunications operator in relation to that system.
An authorisation—
(a) may not authorise any conduct consisting in the interception of
communications in the course of their transmission by means of a
telecommunication system, and
(b) may not authorise an authorised officer to ask or require, in the
circumstances mentioned in subsection (4)(b), (c) or (d), a person to
disclose the data to any person other than—
(i) an authorised officer, or
(ii)
(7)
(8)
an officer of the same relevant public authority as an authorised
officer.
It is necessary and proportionate to obtain communications data for a purpose
falling within this subsection if it is necessary and proportionate to obtain the
data—
(a) in the interests of national security,
(b) for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime or of preventing
disorder,
(c) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom so
far as those interests are also relevant to the interests of national
security,

(e) for the purpose of protecting public health,
(f) for the purpose of assessing or collecting any tax, duty, levy or other
imposition, contribution or charge payable to a government
department,
(g) for the purpose, in an emergency, of preventing death or injury or any
damage to a person’s physical or mental health, or of mitigating any
injury or damage to a person’s physical or mental health,
(h) to assist investigations into alleged miscarriages of justice,
(i) where a person (“P”) has died or is unable to identify themselves
because of a physical or mental condition—
(i) to assist in identifying P, or
(ii) to obtain information about P’s next of kin or other persons
connected with P or about the reason for P’s death or condition,
or
(j) for the purpose of exercising functions relating to—
(i) the regulation of financial services and markets, or
(ii) financial stability.
See—
(a) sections 54 and 57 for the meanings of “designated senior officer” and
“relevant public authority”;
(b) section 68 for the way in which this Part applies to postal operators and
postal services.
Additional restrictions on grant of authorisations
(1)
A designated senior officer may not grant an authorisation for the purposes of
a specific investigation or a specific operation if the officer is working on that
investigation or operation.
(2)
But, if the designated senior officer considers that there are exceptional
circumstances which mean that subsection (1) should not apply in a particular
case, that subsection does not apply in that case.
(3)
Examples of exceptional circumstances include—
(a) an imminent threat to life or another emergency,
(b) the interests of national security, or
(c) the size of the relevant public authority concerned being such that it is
not practicable to have a designated senior officer who is not working
on the investigation or operation concerned.
(4)
(5)
(6)
A designated senior officer of a relevant public authority which is not a local
authority may not grant an authorisation for the purpose of obtaining data
which is already held by a telecommunications operator and which is, or can
only be obtained by processing, an internet connection record unless the
purpose of obtaining the data is to identify—
(a) which person or apparatus is using an internet service where—
(i) the service and time of use are already known, but
(ii) the identity of the person or apparatus using the service is not
known,
(b) which internet communications service is being used, and when and
how it is being used, by a person or apparatus whose identity is already
known, or
(c) where or when a person or apparatus whose identity is already known
is obtaining access to, or running, a computer file or computer program
which wholly or mainly involves making available, or acquiring,
material whose possession is a crime.
A designated senior officer of a local authority may not grant an authorisation
for the purpose of obtaining data which is already held by a
telecommunications operator and which is, or can only be obtained by
processing, an internet connection record.
In this section “internet connection record” means data which—
(a) may be used to identify a telecommunications service to which a
communication is transmitted through a telecommunication system for
the purpose of obtaining access to, or running, a computer file or
computer program, and
(b) is generated or processed by a telecommunications operator in the
process of supplying the telecommunications service to the sender of
the communication (whether or not a person).
Procedure for authorisations and authorised notices
(1)
(2)
(3)
An authorisation must specify—
(a) the office, rank or position held by the designated senior officer
granting it,
(b) the matters falling within section 46(7) by reference to which it is
granted,
(c) the conduct that is authorised,
(d) the data or description of data to be obtained, and
(e) the persons or descriptions of persons to whom the data is to be, or may
be, disclosed or how to identify such persons.
An authorisation which authorises a person to impose requirements by notice
on a telecommunications operator must specify—
(a) the operator concerned, and
(b) the nature of the requirements that are to be imposed,
but need not specify the other contents of the notice.
The notice itself—
(a) must specify—
(i) the office, rank or position held by the person giving it,
(ii) the requirements that are being imposed, and
(iii)
(b)
(4)
the telecommunications operator on whom the requirements
are being imposed, and
must be given in writing or (if not in writing) in a manner that produces
a record of its having been given.
An authorisation must be applied for, and granted, in writing or (if not in
writing) in a manner that produces a record of its having been applied for or
granted.
Duration and cancellation of authorisations and notices
(1)
An authorisation ceases to have effect at the end of the period of one month
beginning with the date on which it is granted.
(2)
An authorisation may be renewed at any time before the end of that period by
the grant of a further authorisation.
(3)
Subsection (1) has effect in relation to a renewed authorisation as if the period
of one month mentioned in that subsection did not begin until the end of the
period of one month applicable to the authorisation that is current at the time
of the renewal.
(4)
A designated senior officer who has granted an authorisation must cancel it if
the designated senior officer considers that the position is no longer as
mentioned in section 46(1)(a), (b) and (c).
(5)
The Secretary of State may by regulations provide for the person by whom any
duty imposed by subsection (4) is to be performed in a case in which it would
otherwise fall on a person who is no longer available to perform it.
(6)
Such regulations may, in particular, provide for the person on whom the duty
is to fall to be a person appointed in accordance with the regulations.
(7)
A notice given in pursuance of an authorisation (and any requirement imposed
by the notice)—
(a) is not affected by the authorisation subsequently ceasing to have effect
under subsection (1), but
(b) is cancelled if the authorisation is cancelled under subsection (4).
Duties of telecommunications operators in relation to authorisations
(1)
It is the duty of a telecommunications operator on whom a requirement is
imposed by notice given in pursuance of an authorisation to comply with that
requirement.
(2)
It is the duty of a telecommunications operator who is obtaining or disclosing
communications data, in response to a request or requirement for the data in
pursuance of an authorisation, to obtain or disclose the data in a way that
minimises the amount of data that needs to be processed for the purpose
concerned.
(3)
(4)
A person who is under a duty by virtue of subsection (1) or (2) is not required
to do anything in pursuance of that duty that it is not reasonably practicable for
that person to do.
The duty imposed by subsection (1) or (2) is enforceable by the Secretary of
State by civil proceedings for an injunction, or for specific performance of a
statutory duty under section 45 of the Court of Session Act 1988, or for any
other appropriate relief.
Filtering arrangements for obtaining data
Filtering arrangements for obtaining data
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
The Secretary of State may establish, maintain and operate arrangements for
the purposes of—
(a) assisting a designated senior officer to determine whether, in any case,
the officer considers as mentioned in section 46(1)(a), (b) and (c) in
relation to the grant of an authorisation in respect of communications
data, or
(b) facilitating the lawful, efficient and effective obtaining of
communications data from any person by relevant public authorities in
pursuance of an authorisation.
Arrangements under subsection (1) (“filtering arrangements”) may, in
particular, involve the obtaining of communications data in pursuance of an
authorisation (“the target data”) by means of—
(a) a request to the Secretary of State to obtain the target data on behalf of
an authorised officer, and
(b) the Secretary of State—
(i) obtaining the target data or data from which the target data may
be derived,
(ii) processing the target data or the data from which it may be
derived (and retaining data temporarily for that purpose), and
(iii) disclosing the target data to the person identified for this
purpose by, or in accordance with, the authorisation.
Filtering arrangements may, in particular, involve the generation or use by the
Secretary of State of information—
(a) for the purpose mentioned in subsection (1)(a), or
(b) for the purposes of—
(i) the support, maintenance, oversight, operation or
administration of the arrangements, or
(ii) the functions of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner
mentioned in subsection (4) or (5).
Filtering arrangements must involve the generation and retention of such
information or documents as the Investigatory Powers Commissioner
considers appropriate for the purposes of the functions of the Commissioner
under section 169(1) of keeping under review the exercise by public authorities
of functions under this Part.
The Secretary of State must consult the Investigatory Powers Commissioner
about the principles on the basis of which the Secretary of State intends to
establish, maintain or operate any arrangements for the purpose mentioned in
subsection (1)(a).
Use of filtering arrangements in pursuance of an authorisation
(1)
This section applies in relation to the use of the filtering arrangements in
pursuance of an authorisation.
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
The filtering arrangements may be used—
(a) to obtain and disclose communications data in pursuance of an
authorisation, only if the authorisation specifically authorises the use of
the arrangements to obtain and disclose the data,
(b) to process data in pursuance of an authorisation (and to retain the data
temporarily for that purpose), only if the authorisation specifically
authorises processing data of that description under the arrangements
(and their temporary retention for that purpose).
An authorisation must record the designated senior officer’s decision as to—
(a) whether the communications data to be obtained and disclosed in
pursuance of the authorisation may be obtained and disclosed by use
of the filtering arrangements,
(b) whether the processing of data under the filtering arrangements (and
its temporary retention for that purpose) is authorised,
(c) if the processing of data under the filtering arrangements is authorised,
the description of data that may be processed.
A designated senior officer must not grant an authorisation which authorises—
(a) use of the filtering arrangements, or
(b) processing under the filtering arrangements,
unless the condition in subsection (5) is met.
(2)
The condition is that the designated senior officer (as well as considering as
mentioned in section 46(1)(a), (b) and (c)) considers that what is authorised in
relation to the filtering arrangements is proportionate to what is sought to be
achieved.
Duties in connection with operation of filtering arrangements
(1)
The Secretary of State must secure—
(a) that no authorisation data is obtained or processed under the filtering
arrangements except for the purposes of an authorisation,
(b) that data which—
(i) has been obtained or processed under the filtering
arrangements, and
(ii) is to be disclosed in pursuance of an authorisation or for the
purpose mentioned in section 51(1)(a),
is disclosed only to the person to whom the data is to be disclosed in
pursuance of the authorisation or (as the case may be) to the designated
senior officer concerned,
(c) that any authorisation data which is obtained under the filtering
arrangements in pursuance of an authorisation is immediately deleted
in such a way as to make access to the data impossible—
(i) when the purposes of the authorisation have been met, or
(ii) if at any time it ceases to be necessary to retain the data for the
purposes or purpose concerned.
The Secretary of State must secure that data (other than authorisation data)
which is retained under the filtering arrangements is disclosed only—
(a) for the purpose mentioned in section 51(1)(a),
(b) for the purposes of support, maintenance, oversight, operation or
administration of the arrangements,
(c)
(d)
(3)

(6)
(7)
to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner for the purposes of the
functions of the Commissioner mentioned in section 51(4) or (5), or
otherwise as authorised by law.
The Secretary of State must secure that—
(a) only the Secretary of State and designated individuals are permitted to
read, obtain or otherwise process data for the purposes of support,
maintenance, oversight, operation or administration of the filtering
arrangements, and
(b) no other persons are permitted to access or use the filtering
arrangements except in pursuance of an authorisation or for the
purpose mentioned in section 51(1)(a).
In subsection (3)(a) “designated” means designated by the Secretary of State;
and the Secretary of State may designate an individual only if the Secretary of
State thinks that it is necessary for the individual to be able to act as mentioned
in subsection (3)(a).
The Secretary of State must—
(a) put in place and maintain an adequate security system to govern access
to, and use of, the filtering arrangements and to protect against any
abuse of the power of access, and
(b) impose measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful data
retention, processing, access or disclosure.
The Secretary of State must—
(a) put in place and maintain procedures (including the regular testing of
relevant software and hardware) to ensure that the filtering
arrangements are functioning properly, and
(b) report, as soon as possible after the end of each calendar year, to the
Investigatory Powers Commissioner about the functioning of the
filtering arrangements during that year.
A report under subsection (6)(b) must, in particular, contain information about
the deletion of authorisation data during the calendar year concerned.
(8)
If the Secretary of State believes that significant processing errors have
occurred giving rise to a contravention of any of the requirements of this Part
which relate to the filtering arrangements, the Secretary of State must report
that fact immediately to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner.
(9)
In this section “authorisation data”, in relation to an authorisation, means
communications data that is, or is to be, obtained in pursuance of the
authorisation or any data from which that data is, or may be, derived.

Collaboration agreements
Collaboration agreements
(1)
(2)
(3)
A collaboration agreement is an agreement (other than a police collaboration
agreement) under which—
(a) a relevant public authority (“the supplying authority”) puts the services

authority at the disposal of another relevant public authority (“the
subscribing authority”) for the purposes of the subscribing authority’s
functions under this Part, and
(b) either—
(i) a designated senior officer of the supplying authority is
permitted to grant authorisations to officers of the subscribing
authority,
(ii) officers of the supplying authority are permitted to be granted
authorisations by a designated senior officer of the subscribing

for officers of the subscribing authority.
The persons by whom, or to whom, authorisations may be granted (or who
may act as single points of contact) under a collaboration agreement are
additional to those persons by whom, or to whom, authorisations would
otherwise be granted under this Part (or who could otherwise act as single

communication, the day of the communication concerned,
(b) in the case of entity data which does not fall within paragraph (a) above
but does fall within paragraph (a)(i) of the definition of
“communications data” in section 193(5), the day on which the entity
(c)
concerned ceases to be associated with the telecommunications service
concerned or (if earlier) the day on which the data is changed, and
in any other case, the day on which the data is first held by the operator
concerned.
(4)
A retention notice which relates to data already in existence when the notice
comes into force imposes a requirement to retain the data for only so much of
a period of retention as occurs on or after the coming into force of the notice.
(5)
A retention notice comes into force—
(a) when the notice is given to the operator (or description of operators)
concerned, or
(b) (if later) at the time or times specified in the notice.
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)
A retention notice is given to an operator (or description of operators) by
giving, or publishing, it in such manner as the Secretary of State considers

operators) to whom it relates.
A retention notice must specify—
(a) the operator (or description of operators) to whom it relates,

which, or by means of which, a communication is or may be
transmitted,
(e) the location of any such system, or

Safeguards
Matters to be taken into account before giving retention notices
(1)
(2)
Before giving a retention notice, the Secretary of State must, among other
matters, take into account—
(a) the likely benefits of the notice,
(b) the likely number of users (if known) of any telecommunications
service to which the notice relates,
(c) the technical feasibility of complying with the notice,
(d) the likely cost of complying with the notice, and
(e) any other effect of the notice on the telecommunications operator (or
description of operators) to whom it relates.
Before giving such a notice, the Secretary of State must take reasonable steps to
consult any operator to whom it relates.
Review by the Secretary of State
(1)
A telecommunications operator to whom a retention notice is given may,
within such period or circumstances as may be provided for by regulations
made by the Secretary of State, refer the notice back to the Secretary of State.
(2)
Such a reference may be in relation to the whole of a notice or any aspect of it.
(3)
In the case of a notice given to a description of operators—
(a) each operator falling within that description may make a reference
under subsection (1), but
(b) each such reference may only be in relation to the notice, or aspect of
the notice, so far as it applies to that operator.
(4)
There is no requirement for an operator who has referred a retention notice
under subsection (1) to comply with the notice, so far as referred, until the
Secretary of State has reviewed the notice in accordance with subsection (5).
(5)
The Secretary of State must review any notice so far as referred to the Secretary
of State under subsection (1).
(6)
Before deciding the review, the Secretary of State must consult—
(a) the Technical Advisory Board, and
(b) the Investigatory Powers Commissioner.
(7)
The Board must consider the technical requirements and the financial
consequences, for the operator who has made the reference, of the notice so far
as referred.
(8)
The Commissioner must consider whether the notice so far as referred is
proportionate.
(9)
The Board and the Commissioner must—
(a) give the operator concerned the opportunity to provide evidence to
them before reaching their conclusions, and
(b) report their conclusions to—
(i) the operator, and
(ii) the Secretary of State.
(10)
The Secretary of State may, after considering the conclusions of the Board and
the Commissioner—
(a) vary or revoke the retention notice under section 76, or
(b) give a notice under this section to the operator concerned confirming its
effect.
(11)
A report or notice under this section is given to an operator by giving or
publishing it in such manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for
bringing it to the attention of the operator.
(12)
The Secretary of State must keep a retention notice under review (whether or
not referred under subsection (1)).
Data integrity and security
(1)
A telecommunications operator who retains relevant communications data by
virtue of this Part must—
(a) secure that the data is of the same integrity, and subject to at least the
same security and protection, as the data on any system from which it
is derived,
(b) secure, by appropriate technical and organisational measures, that the
data can be accessed only by specially authorised personnel, and
(c) protect, by appropriate technical and organisational measures, the data
against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration,
or unauthorised or unlawful retention, processing, access or disclosure.
(2)
A telecommunications operator who retains relevant communications data by
virtue of this Part must destroy the data if the retention of the data ceases to be
authorised by virtue of this Part and is not otherwise authorised by law.
(3)
The requirement in subsection (2) to destroy the data is a requirement to delete
the data in such a way as to make access to the data impossible.
(4)
The deletion of the data may take place at such monthly or shorter intervals as
appear to the operator to be practicable.
Disclosure of retained data
A telecommunications operator must put in place adequate security systems
(including technical and organisational measures) governing access to relevant
communications data retained by virtue of this Part in order to protect against
any unlawful disclosure.
Variation or revocation of notices
Variation or revocation of notices
(1)
The Secretary of State may vary a retention notice.
(2)
The Secretary of State must give, or publish, notice of the variation in such
manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for bringing the
variation to the attention of the telecommunications operator (or description of
operators) to whom it relates.
(3)
A variation comes into force—
(a)
(b)
(4)
(5)
when notice of it is given or published in accordance with subsection
(2), or
(if later) at the time or times specified in the notice of variation.
A retention notice may not be varied so as to require the retention of additional
relevant communications data unless the Secretary of State considers that the
requirement is necessary and proportionate for one or more of the purposes
falling within paragraphs (a) to (j) of section 46(7) (purposes for which
communications data may be obtained).
Section 71(2) and (4) apply in relation to a retention notice as varied as they
apply in relation to a retention notice, but as if the references to the notice
coming into force included references to the variation coming into force.
(6)
Sections 71(3) and (8), 77 and 79, and subsections (1), (4), (9) and (12) of this
section, apply in relation to a retention notice as varied as they apply in relation
to a retention notice.
(7)
Section 72 applies in relation to the making of a variation as it applies in
relation to the giving of a retention notice.
(8)
Section 73 applies in relation to a retention notice as varied (other than one
varied as mentioned in subsection (10)(a) of that section) as it applies in
relation to a retention notice.
(9)
The Secretary of State may revoke (whether wholly or in part) a retention
notice.
(10)
The Secretary of State must give or publish notice of the revocation in such
manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for bringing the
revocation to the attention of the operator (or description of operators) to
whom it relates.
(11)
A revocation comes into force—
(a) when notice of it is given or published in accordance with subsection
(10), or
(b) (if later) at the time or times specified in the notice of revocation.
(12)
The fact that a retention notice has been revoked in relation to a particular
description of communications data and a particular operator (or description
of operators) does not prevent the giving of another retention notice in relation
to the same description of data and the same operator (or description of
operators).
Enforcement
Enforcement of notices and certain other requirements and restrictions
(1)
(2)
It is the duty of a telecommunications operator on whom a requirement or
restriction is imposed by—
(a) a retention notice, or
(b) section 74 or 75,
to comply with the requirement or restriction.
A telecommunications operator, or any person employed for the purposes of
the business of a telecommunications operator, must not disclose the existence
and contents of a retention notice to any other person.
(3)
The duty under subsection (1) or (2) is enforceable by civil proceedings by the
Secretary of State for an injunction, or for specific performance of a statutory
duty under section 45 of the Court of Session Act 1988, or for any other
appropriate relief.

within paragraph (a) above but does fall within
paragraph (c) of the definition of “communications
data” in section 194(3), the day on which the person
concerned leaves the postal service concerned or (if
earlier) the day on which the data is changed,”, and
(e) in section 71(9), in the definition of “relevant communications data”,
paragraph (f) were omitted.
Extra-territorial application of Part 4
(1)
A retention notice, and any requirement or restriction imposed by virtue of a
retention notice or by section 74 or 75, may relate to conduct outside the United
Kingdom and persons outside the United Kingdom.
(2)
Section 77(1) has effect, in relation to a requirement or restriction imposed by
virtue of a retention notice or by section 74 or 75 and which relates to conduct
or persons outside the United Kingdom, as a duty to have regard to the
requirement or restriction (rather than comply with it).

PART 5
EQUIPMENT INTERFERENCE
Warrants under this Part
Warrants under this Part: general
(1)
There are two kinds of warrants that may be issued under this Part—
(a) targeted equipment interference warrants (see subsection (2));
(b) targeted examination warrants (see subsection (9)).
(2)
A targeted equipment interference warrant is a warrant that authorises the
person to whom it is addressed to secure interference with any equipment for
the purpose of facilitating the obtaining of one or more of the following—
(a) communications (see section 105);
(b) private information (see section 105);
(c) equipment data (see section 82).
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
A targeted equipment interference warrant may also authorise the person to
whom it is addressed to secure—
(a) the obtaining of any communications, private information or
equipment data to which the purpose of the warrant relates;
(b) the obtaining of any information that does not fall within paragraph (a)
but is connected with the equipment to which the warrant relates;
(c) the disclosure, in such manner as may be described in the warrant, of
any material obtained under the warrant by virtue of paragraph (a) or
(b).
The reference in subsections (2) and (3) to the obtaining of communications or
private information includes doing so by—
(a) monitoring, observing or listening to a person’s communications or
other activities;
(b) recording anything that is monitored, observed or listened to.
A targeted equipment interference warrant also authorises the following
conduct (in addition to the conduct described in the warrant)—
(a) any conduct that it is necessary to undertake in order to do what is
expressly authorised by the warrant, including conduct for securing the
obtaining of—
(i) communications;
(ii) private information;
(iii) equipment data;
(iv) information that does not fall within sub-paragraphs (i) to (iii)
but is connected with the equipment to which the warrant
relates; and
(b) any conduct by any person that is in pursuance of a requirement
imposed by or on behalf of the person to whom the warrant is
addressed to be provided with assistance in giving effect to the
warrant.
A targeted equipment interference warrant may not, by virtue of subsection
(3), authorise a person to engage in conduct, in relation to a communication
other than a stored communication, that would (unless done with lawful
authority) constitute an offence under section 2(1) (unlawful interception).
(7)
Subsection (5)(a) does not authorise a person to engage in conduct that could
not be expressly authorised under the warrant because of the restriction
imposed by subsection (6).
(8)
In subsection (6), “stored communication” means a communication stored in or
by a telecommunication system.
(9)
A targeted examination warrant is a warrant that authorises the person to
whom it is addressed to carry out the examination of material obtained under
a bulk equipment interference warrant.
For provision about bulk equipment interference warrants, see Chapter 3 of
Part 6.
(10)
For provision enabling the combination of targeted equipment interference
warrants with certain other warrants or authorisations (including targeted
examination warrants), see Schedule 7.

(2)
Data falls within this subsection if it identifies or describes anything connected
with enabling or otherwise facilitating the functioning of a relevant system
(including any apparatus in it) or of any service provided by means of the
system.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2), a system is a relevant system if any
communications or private information are held on or by means of the system.
(4)
(5)
Data falls within this subsection if, for the purposes of a relevant system, it is
comprised in, included as part of, attached to or logically associated with a
communication or an item of private information and either—
(a) it does not form part of the content of the communication or the item of
private information, or
(b) if it does, it is capable of being logically separated from the remainder
of the content in such a way that (after being separated)—

The Secretary of State must ensure, in relation to every bulk interception
warrant, that arrangements are in force for securing—
(a) that the requirements of subsections (2) and (5) are met in relation to the
intercepted material and related communications data obtained under
the warrant, and
(b) that the requirements of section 119 are met in relation to that material
and data.
This is subject to subsection (8).
The requirements of this subsection are met in relation to the intercepted
material and related communications data obtained under a warrant if each of
the following is limited to the minimum that is necessary for the authorised
purposes (see subsection (3))—
(a) the number of persons to whom any of the material or data is disclosed
or otherwise made available;
(b) the extent to which any of the material or data is disclosed or otherwise
made available;
(c) the extent to which any of the material or data is copied;
(d) the number of copies that are made.
For the purposes of subsection (2) something is necessary for the authorised
purposes if, and only if—

or on any other grounds falling within section 107(2),
(b) it is necessary for facilitating the carrying out of any functions under
this Act of the Secretary of State, the Scottish Ministers or the head of

(e) it is necessary for the performance of any duty imposed on any person
by the Public Records Act 1958 or the Public Records Act (Northern
Ireland) 1923.
The arrangements for the time being in force under this section for securing
that the requirements of subsection (2) are met in relation to the intercepted
material and related communications data obtained under the warrant must
include arrangements for securing that every copy made of any of that material
or data is stored, for so long as it is retained, in a secure manner.

(2)
The requirements of this subsection are met in relation to the intercepted
material and related communications data obtained under a warrant if every
copy made of any of that material or data (if not destroyed earlier) is destroyed
as soon there are no longer any relevant grounds for retaining it (see subsection
(6)).
For the purposes of subsection (5), there are no longer any relevant grounds for
retaining a copy of any material or data if, and only if—
(a) its retention is not necessary, or not likely to become necessary, in the
interests of national security or on any other grounds falling within
section 107(2), and
(b) its retention is not necessary for any of the purposes mentioned in
paragraphs (b) to (e) of subsection (3) above.
Subsection (8) applies if—

(b) a copy of any such material or data has been given to any overseas
authorities.
To the extent that the requirements of subsections (2) and (5) relate to any of
the material or data mentioned in subsection (7)(a), or to the copy mentioned
in subsection (7)(b), the arrangements made for the purposes of this section are
not required to secure that those requirements are met (see instead section 118).
In this section—
“copy”, in relation to intercepted material or related communications data
obtained under a bulk interception warrant, means any of the following
(whether or not in documentary form)—
(a) any copy, extract or summary of the material or data which
identifies itself as having been obtained under the warrant, and
(b) any record referring to any interception or to the obtaining of
any related communications data which is a record of the
identities of the persons to or by whom the material was sent, or
to whom the data relates,
and “copied” is to be read accordingly;
“overseas authorities” means authorities of a country or territory outside
the United Kingdom.
Safeguards relating to disclosure of material or data overseas
The Secretary of State must ensure, in relation to every bulk interception
warrant, that arrangements are in force for securing that—

obtained under the warrant is handed over to overseas authorities only
if the requirements of subsection (2) are met, and
(b) copies of any of that material or data are given to overseas authorities
only if those requirements are met.
The requirements of this subsection are met in the case of a warrant if it appears
to the Secretary of State—
(a) that requirements corresponding to the requirements of section 117(2)
and (5) (“the relevant requirements”) will apply, to such extent (if any)
as the Secretary of State considers appropriate, in relation to any of the
(b)
intercepted material or related communications data which is handed
over, or any copy of which is given, to the authorities in question, and
that restrictions are in force which would prevent, to such extent (if
any) as the Secretary of State considers appropriate, the doing of
anything in, for the purposes of or in connection with any proceedings
outside the United Kingdom which would result in an unauthorised
disclosure.
(3)
In subsection (2)(b) “unauthorised disclosure” means a disclosure which, by
virtue of section 42, could not be made in the United Kingdom.

Safeguards relating to examination of material or data
For the purposes of section 117 the requirements of this section are met in
relation to the intercepted material and related communications data obtained
under a warrant if—
(a) any examination of the intercepted material or related communications
data is carried out only for the specified purposes (see subsection (2)),
(b) the selection of any of the intercepted material or related
communications data for examination is necessary and proportionate
in all the circumstances, and
(c) the selection of any of the intercepted material for examination meets
any of the selection conditions (see subsection (3)).
Examination of intercepted material or related communications data is carried
out only for the specified purposes if the material or data is examined only so
far as is necessary for the operational purposes specified in the warrant in
accordance with section 111.
In this subsection “specified in the warrant” means specified in the warrant at
the time of the selection of the material or data for examination.
The selection conditions referred to in subsection (1)(c) are—
(a) that the selection of the intercepted material for examination does not
breach the prohibition in subsection (4);
(b) that the person to whom the warrant is addressed considers that the
selection of the intercepted material for examination would not breach
that prohibition;
(c) that the selection of the intercepted material for examination in breach
of that prohibition is authorised by subsection (5);
(d) that a targeted examination warrant has been issued under Chapter 1
of Part 2 authorising the examination of the intercepted material.
The prohibition referred to in subsection (3)(a) is that intercepted material may
not at any time be selected for examination if—
(a) any criteria used for the selection of the material for examination are
referable to an individual known to be in the British Islands at that time,
and
(b) the purpose of using those criteria is to identify the content of
communications sent by, or intended for, that individual.
It does not matter for the purposes of this subsection whether the identity of
the individual is known.
(5)
(6)
(7)
The selection of intercepted material (“the relevant material”) for examination
is authorised by this subsection if—
(a) criteria referable to an individual have been, or are being, used for the
selection of material for examination in circumstances falling within
subsection (3)(a) or (b),
(b) at any time it appears to the person to whom the warrant is addressed
that there has been a relevant change of circumstances in relation to the
individual (see subsection (6)) which would mean that the selection of
the relevant material for examination would breach the prohibition in
subsection (4),
(c) since that time, a written authorisation to examine the relevant material
using those criteria has been given by a senior official, and
(d) the selection of the relevant material for examination is made before the
end of the permitted period (see subsection (7)).
For the purposes of subsection (5)(b) there is a relevant change of
circumstances in relation to an individual if—
(a) the individual has entered the British Islands, or
(b) a belief by the person to whom the warrant is addressed that the
individual was outside the British Islands was in fact mistaken.
In subsection (5) “the permitted period” means the period ending with the fifth
working day after the time mentioned in subsection (5)(b).
Application of other restrictions in relation to warrants
(1)
Section 42 and Schedule 3 (exclusion of matters from legal proceedings) apply
in relation to bulk interception warrants as they apply in relation to targeted
interception warrants.
(2)
Sections 43 and 44 (duty not to make unauthorised disclosures) apply in
relation to bulk interception warrants as they apply in relation to targeted
interception warrants, but as if the reference in section 43(5)(d) to a disclosure
authorised by section 29(5) included a reference to a disclosure authorised by
section 116(4).

CHAPTER 2
BULK ACQUISITION WARRANTS
Bulk acquisition warrants
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
Power to issue bulk acquisition warrants
The Secretary of State may, on an application made by or on behalf of the head
of an intelligence service, issue a bulk acquisition warrant if—
(a) the Secretary of State considers that the warrant is necessary—
(i) in the interests of national security, or
(ii) on that ground and on any other grounds falling within
subsection (2),
(b) the Secretary of State considers that the conduct authorised by the
warrant is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that
conduct,
(c) the Secretary of State considers that—
(i) the examination of communications data obtained under the
warrant is necessary for one or more of the specified operational
purposes (see subsection (9)), and
(ii) any examination of that data for those purposes is necessary as
mentioned in paragraph (a),
(d) the Secretary of State considers that satisfactory arrangements made for
the purposes of section 131 (general safeguards) are in force in relation
to the warrant, and
(e) the decision to issue the warrant has been approved by a Judicial
Commissioner.
A warrant is necessary on grounds falling within this subsection if it is
necessary—
(a) for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime, or
(b) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom so
far as those interests are also relevant to the interests of national
security.
A warrant may be considered necessary on the ground falling within
subsection (2)(b) only if the communications data which it is considered
necessary to obtain is communications data relating to the acts or intentions of
persons outside the British Islands.
The matters to be taken into account in considering whether the conditions in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) are met include whether the
communications data which it is thought necessary to obtain under the
warrant could reasonably be obtained by other means.
A bulk acquisition warrant is a warrant which authorises or requires the
person to whom it is addressed to secure, by any conduct described in the
warrant, any one or more of the activities in subsection (6).
(6)
(7)
(8)
The activities are—
(a) requiring a telecommunications operator specified in the warrant—
(i) to disclose to a person specified in the warrant any
communications data which is specified in the warrant and is in
the possession of the operator,
(ii) to obtain any communications data specified in the warrant
which is not in the possession of the operator but which the
operator is capable of obtaining, and
(iii) to disclose to a person specified in the warrant any data
obtained as mentioned in sub-paragraph (ii),
(b) the selection for examination, in any manner specified in the warrant,
of communications data obtained under the warrant,
(c) the disclosure, in any manner specified in the warrant, of such data to
the person to whom the warrant is addressed or to any person acting
on that person’s behalf.
A bulk acquisition warrant also authorises the following conduct (in addition
to the conduct specified in the warrant)—
(a) any conduct which it is necessary to undertake in order to do what is
expressly authorised or required by the warrant, and
(b) conduct by any person which is conduct in pursuance of a requirement
imposed by or on behalf of the person to whom the warrant is
addressed to be provided with assistance in giving effect to the
warrant.
A bulk acquisition warrant may relate to data whether or not in existence at the
time of the issuing of the warrant.
(9)
An application for the issue of a bulk acquisition warrant may only be made on
behalf of the head of an intelligence service by a person holding office under
the Crown.
(10)
In this section—
“specified operational purposes” means the operational purposes
specified in the warrant in accordance with section 125,
and for the meaning of “head of an intelligence service” see section 195.
(1)
Approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners
In deciding whether to approve a decision to issue a warrant under section 122,
a Judicial Commissioner must review the Secretary of State’s conclusions as to
the following matters—
(a) whether the warrant is necessary as mentioned in subsection (1)(a) of
that section,
(b) whether the conduct that would be authorised by the warrant is
proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct, and
(c) whether—
(i) the examination of communications data obtained under the
warrant is necessary for one or more of the specified operational
purposes, and
(ii) any examination of that data for those purposes is necessary as
mentioned in subsection (1)(a) of that section.
(2)
In doing so, the Judicial Commissioner must apply the same principles as
would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review.
(3)
Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a decision to issue a
warrant under section 122, the Judicial Commissioner must give the Secretary
of State written reasons for the refusal.
(4)
Where a Judicial Commissioner, other than the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner, refuses to approve a decision to issue a warrant under section
122, the Secretary of State may ask the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to
decide whether to approve the decision to issue the warrant.
(5)
In this section “specified operational purposes” has the same meaning as in
section 122.
The decision to issue a bulk acquisition warrant must be taken personally by
the Secretary of State.
(2)
Before a bulk acquisition warrant is issued, it must be signed by the Secretary
of State.
Requirements that must be met by warrants
(1)
A bulk acquisition warrant must contain a provision stating that it is a bulk
acquisition warrant.
(2)
A bulk acquisition warrant must be addressed to the head of the intelligence
service by whom, or on whose behalf, the application for the warrant was
made.
(3)
A bulk acquisition warrant must specify the operational purposes for which
any communications data obtained under the warrant may be selected for
examination.
(4)
Decisions to issue warrants to be taken personally by Secretary of State
(1)
In specifying any operational purposes, it is not sufficient simply to use the
descriptions contained in section 122(1)(a) or (2), but the purposes may still be
general purposes.
Duration, modification and cancellation of warrants
(1)
(2)
Duration of warrants
A bulk acquisition warrant ceases to have effect at the end of the period of 6
months beginning with—
(a) the day on which the warrant was issued, or
(b) in the case of a warrant that has been renewed, the day after the day at
the end of which the warrant would have ceased to have effect if it had
not been renewed.
For provision about the renewal of warrants, see section 127.
Renewal of warrants
(1)
If the renewal conditions are met, a bulk acquisition warrant may be renewed,
at any time before it would otherwise cease to have effect, by an instrument
issued by the Secretary of State.
(2)
The renewal conditions are—
(a) that the Secretary of State considers that the warrant continues to be
necessary—
(i) in the interests of national security, or
(ii) on that ground and on any other grounds falling within section
122(2),
(b) that the Secretary of State considers that the conduct that would be
authorised by the renewed warrant continues to be proportionate to
what is sought to be achieved by that conduct,
(c) that the Secretary of State considers that—
(i) the examination of communications data obtained under the
warrant continues to be necessary for one or more of the
specified operational purposes, and
(ii) any examination of that data for those purposes continues to be
necessary as mentioned in paragraph (a), and
(d) that the decision to renew the warrant has been approved by a Judicial
Commissioner.
(3)
The decision to renew a bulk acquisition warrant must be taken personally by
the Secretary of State and the instrument renewing the warrant must be signed
by the Secretary of State.
(4)
Section 123 (approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners) applies in
relation to a decision to renew a bulk acquisition warrant as it applies in
relation to a decision to issue a bulk acquisition warrant.
(5)
In this section “specified operational purposes” has the same meaning as in
section 122.
Modification of warrants
(1)
The provisions of a bulk acquisition warrant may be modified at any time by
an instrument issued by the person making the modification.
(2)
The only modifications that may be made under this section are adding,
varying or removing any operational purpose specified in the warrant as a
purpose for which any communications data obtained under the warrant may
be selected for examination.
(3)
The decision to modify the provisions of a warrant must be taken personally
by the person making the modification, and the instrument making the
modification must be signed by that person.
(4)
A modification adding or varying any operational purpose as mentioned in
subsection (2)—
(a) must be made by the Secretary of State, and
(b) has effect only if the decision to make the modification is approved by
a Judicial Commissioner.
(5)
Section 123 (approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners) applies in
relation to a decision to modify a bulk acquisition warrant as mentioned in
subsection (4) as it applies in relation to the decision to issue a bulk acquisition
warrant.
(6)
A modification removing any operational purpose may be made by—
(a) the Secretary of State, or
(b) a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of State.
(7)
The Secretary of State may make a modification of a bulk acquisition warrant
adding or varying any operational purpose as mentioned in subsection (2) only
if the Secretary of State considers that the modification is necessary—
(a) in the interests of national security, or
(b) on that ground and on any other grounds falling within section 122(2).
(8)
(9)
Where a modification of a bulk acquisition warrant is made by a senior official,
the Secretary of State must be notified personally of the modification and the
reasons for making it.
Nothing in this section applies in relation to modifying the provisions of a
warrant in a way which does not affect the conduct authorised or required by
it.
Cancellation of warrants
(1)
The Secretary of State, or a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of
State, may cancel a bulk acquisition warrant at any time.
(2)
If the Secretary of State, or a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of
State, considers—
(a) that a bulk acquisition warrant is no longer necessary in the interests of
national security, or
(b) that the conduct authorised by the warrant is no longer proportionate
to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct,
the person must cancel the warrant.
Implementation of warrants
(1)
(2)
Implementation of warrants
In giving effect to a bulk acquisition warrant, the person to whom it is
addressed (“the implementing authority”) may (in addition to acting alone) act
through, or together with, such other persons as the implementing authority
may require (whether under subsection (2) or otherwise) to provide the
authority with assistance in giving effect to the warrant.
For the purpose of requiring any person to provide assistance in relation to a
bulk acquisition warrant, the implementing authority may—
(a) serve a copy of the warrant on any person whom the implementing
authority considers may be able to provide such assistance, or
(b) make arrangements for the service of a copy of the warrant on any such
person.
(3)
A copy of a warrant may be served under subsection (2) on a person outside
the United Kingdom for the purpose of requiring the person to provide such
assistance in the form of conduct outside the United Kingdom.
(4)
For the purposes of this Act, the provision of assistance in giving effect to a
bulk acquisition warrant includes any disclosure to the implementing
authority, or to persons acting on behalf of the implementing authority, of
communications data obtained under the warrant.
(5)
(6)
(7)
Sections 30 (service of warrants) and 31(1) to (6) (duty of operators to assist
with implementation) apply in relation to a bulk acquisition warrant as they
apply in relation to a targeted interception warrant but as if only a
telecommunications operator were a relevant operator for the purposes of
section 31(1) to (6).
The duty imposed by virtue of subsection (5) above and section 31(1) is
enforceable against a person in the United Kingdom by civil proceedings by
the Secretary of State for an injunction, or for specific performance of a
statutory duty under section 45 of the Court of Session Act 1988, or for any
other appropriate relief.
References in this section (and in sections 30 and 31(1) to (6) as they apply in
relation to bulk acquisition warrants) to the service of a copy of a warrant
include—
(a) the service of a copy of one or more schedules contained in the warrant

warrant, that arrangements are in force for securing—
(a) that the requirements of subsections (2) and (5) are met in relation to the
communications data obtained under the warrant, and

any) as that person considers appropriate, in relation to the data or copy.
In this section—
“copy”, in relation to communications data obtained under a bulk
acquisition warrant, means any of the following (whether or not in
documentary form)—

(b) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom so
far as those interests are also relevant to the interests of national
security.
A warrant may be considered necessary on the ground falling within
subsection (2)(b) only if the interference with equipment that would be
authorised by the warrant is considered necessary to facilitate the obtaining of
material relating to the acts or intentions of persons outside the British Islands.
The matters to be taken into account in considering whether the conditions in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) are met include whether what could be
achieved under the warrant could reasonably be achieved by other means.
(5)
In subsection 1(d)(i), “specified operational purposes” means the operational
purposes specified in the warrant in accordance with section 140(4).
(6)

whether—
(i) the examination of any material obtained under the warrant is
necessary for one or more of the specified operational purposes,
and
(ii) any examination of that material for those purposes is necessary
as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) of section 137.
In doing so, the Judicial Commissioner must apply the same principles as
would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review.
(3)
Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a decision to issue a
warrant under section 137, the Judicial Commissioner must give the Secretary
of State written reasons for the refusal.
(4)
Where a Judicial Commissioner, other than the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner, refuses to approve a decision to issue a warrant, the Secretary
of State may ask the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to decide whether to

to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct,
the person must cancel the warrant.
Implementation of warrants
(1)
(2)
Implementation of warrants
In giving effect to a bulk equipment interference warrant, the person to whom
it is addressed (“the implementing authority”) may (in addition to acting
alone) act through, or together with, such other persons as the implementing
authority may require (whether under subsection (2) or otherwise) to provide
the authority with assistance in giving effect to the warrant.
For the purpose of requiring any person to provide assistance in relation to a

(3)
(4)
General safeguards
This section applies in relation to every bulk equipment interference warrant
that includes authorisation to secure the obtaining of communications, private
information, equipment data or other information connected with the
equipment to which the warrant relates.
The Secretary of State must ensure that arrangements are in force for
securing—
(a) that the requirements of subsections (3) and (6) are met in relation to the
material obtained under the warrant, and
(b) that the requirements of section 147 are met in relation to that material.
This is subject to subsection (8).
The requirements of this subsection are met in relation to the material obtained
under the warrant if each of the following is limited to the minimum that is
necessary for the authorised purposes (see subsection (4))—
(a) the number of persons to whom any of the material is disclosed or
otherwise made available;
(b) the extent to which any of the material is disclosed or otherwise made
available;
(c) the extent to which any of the material is copied;
(d) the number of copies that are made.
For the purposes of subsection (3) something is necessary for the authorised
purposes if, and only if—
(a) it is, or is likely to become, necessary in the interests of national security
or on any other grounds falling within section 137(2),
(b) it is necessary for facilitating the carrying out of any functions under
this Act of the Secretary of State, the Scottish Ministers or the head of
the intelligence service to whom the warrant is addressed,
(c) it is necessary for facilitating the carrying out of any functions of the
Investigatory Powers Commissioner or of the Investigatory Powers
Tribunal under or in relation to this Act,
(d) it is necessary for the purpose of legal proceedings, or
(e)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)
(10)
(1)
it is necessary for the performance of the functions of any person by or
under any enactment.
The arrangements for the time being in force under this section for securing
that the requirements of subsection (3) are met in relation to the material
obtained under the warrant must include arrangements for securing that every
copy made of any of that material is stored, for so long as it is retained, in a
secure manner.
The requirements of this subsection are met in relation to the material obtained
under the warrant if every copy made of any of that material (if not destroyed
earlier) is destroyed as soon as there are no longer any relevant grounds for
retaining it (see subsection (7)).
For the purposes of subsection (6), there are no longer any relevant grounds for
retaining a copy of any material if, and only if—
(a) its retention is not necessary, or not likely to become necessary, in the
interests of national security or on any other grounds falling within
section 137(2), and
(b) its retention is not necessary for any of the purposes mentioned in
paragraphs (b) to (e) of subsection (4) above.
Subsections (3) and (6) do not apply so far as possession of the material or any
copy of it has been handed over to any authorities of a country or territory
outside the United Kingdom.
But the Secretary of State must ensure that arrangements are in force for
securing that possession of the material or any copy of it is handed over to
authorities of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom only if the
intelligence service considers that arrangements corresponding to those
mentioned in subsections (3) and (6) will apply, to such extent (if any) as the
intelligence service considers appropriate, in relation to the material or copy.
In this section “copy”, in relation to material, means any of the following
(whether or not in documentary form)—
(a) any copy, extract or summary of the material which identifies itself as
the product of a bulk equipment interference warrant, and
(b) any record which is a record of the identities of persons who owned,
used or were in possession of equipment interfered with under such a
warrant,
and “copied” is to be read accordingly.
Safeguards relating to examination of material etc.
For the purposes of section 146, the requirements of this section are met in
relation to the material obtained under a warrant if—
(a) any examination of the material obtained under the warrant is carried
out only for the specified purposes (see subsection (2)),
(b) the selection of any of the material for examination is necessary and
proportionate in all the circumstances, and
(c) where any such material is protected material, the selection of the
material for examination meets any of the selection conditions (see
subsection (3)).
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
Examination of the material is carried out only for the specified purposes if the
material is examined only so far as is necessary for the operational purposes
specified in the warrant in accordance with section 140(4).
In this subsection “specified” means specified at the time of the selection of the
material for examination.
The selection conditions referred to in subsection (1)(c) are—
(a) that the selection of the protected material for examination does not
breach the prohibition in subsection (4);
(b) that the person to whom the warrant is addressed reasonably considers
that the selection of the protected material for examination would not
breach that prohibition;
(c) that the selection of the protected material for examination in breach of
that prohibition is authorised by subsection (5);
(d) that a targeted examination warrant has been issued under Part 5
authorising the examination of the protected material.
The prohibition referred to in subsection (3)(a) is that the protected material
may not at any time be selected for examination if—
(a) any criteria used for the selection of the material for examination are
referable to an individual known to be in the British Islands at that time,
and
(b) the purpose of using those criteria is to identify the content of
communications sent by, or intended for, that individual or the content
of private information relating to that individual.
It does not matter for the purposes of this subsection whether the identity of
the individual is known.
The selection of protected material (“the relevant material”) for examination is
authorised by this subsection if—
(a) criteria referable to an individual have been, or are being, used for the
selection of material for examination in circumstances falling within
subsection (3)(a) or (b),
(b) at any time it appears to the person to whom the warrant is addressed
that there has been a relevant change of circumstances in relation to the
individual (see subsection (6)) which would mean that the selection of
the relevant material for examination would breach the prohibition in
subsection (4),
(c) since that time, a written authorisation to examine the relevant material
using those criteria has been given by a senior official, and
(d) the selection of the relevant material for examination is made before the
end of the permitted period (see subsection (7)).
(6)
For the purposes of subsection (5)(b) there is a relevant change of
circumstances in relation to an individual if—
(a) the individual has entered the British Islands, or
(b) a belief by the person to whom the warrant is addressed that the
individual was outside the British Islands was in fact mistaken.
(7)
In subsection (5), “the permitted period” means the period ending with the
fifth working day after the time mentioned in subsection (5)(b).
(8)
In this section, “protected material” means any material obtained under the
warrant other than—
(a) equipment data, or
(b)
information connected with the equipment to which the warrant relates
but that is not a communication, private information or equipment
data.
Application of other restrictions in relation to warrants under this Chapter
Section 102 (offence of making unauthorised disclosure) applies in relation to
bulk equipment interference warrants as it applies in relation to targeted
equipment interference warrants.

(6)
(7)
except where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent
need to issue the warrant, the decision to issue it has been approved by
a Judicial Commissioner.
A specific BPD warrant relating to a bulk personal dataset (“dataset A”) may
also authorise the obtaining, retention and examination, or the retention and
examination, of other bulk personal datasets (“replacement datasets”) that do
not exist at the time of the issue of the warrant but may reasonably be regarded
as replacements for dataset A.
A specific BPD warrant must—
(a) describe the bulk personal dataset to which the warrant relates,
(b) where the warrant authorises the obtaining, retention and examination,
or the retention and examination, of replacement datasets, include a
description that will enable those datasets to be identified, and
(c) specify the operational purposes for which the bulk personal dataset
and any replacement datasets may be examined.
(8)
An examination that is not for an operational purpose specified in the warrant
is not authorised by the warrant.
(9)
An application for a specific BPD warrant may only be made on behalf of the
head of an intelligence service by a person holding office under the Crown.
(1)
Approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners
In deciding whether to approve the Secretary of State’s decision to issue a class
BPD warrant or a specific BPD warrant, a Judicial Commissioner must review
the Secretary of State’s conclusions on the following matters—
(a) whether the warrant is necessary on grounds falling within section
153(3)(a) or (as the case may be) section 154(5)(a),
(b) whether the conduct that would be authorised by the warrant is
proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct, and
(c) whether—
(i) the examination that would be authorised by the warrant is
necessary for one or more operational purposes specified in it in
accordance with section 153(4)(b) or (as the case may be)
154(7)(c), and
(ii) any examination for those purposes is necessary as mentioned
in paragraph (a).
(2)
In doing so, the Judicial Commissioner must apply the same principles as
would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review.
(3)
Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a decision to issue a
warrant, the Judicial Commissioner must give the Secretary of State written
reasons for the refusal.
(1)
Approval of warrants issued in urgent cases

The Secretary of State must inform a Judicial Commissioner that it has been
issued.

done in reliance on the warrant stops as soon as possible.
(3)
The Judicial Commissioner who refused to approve the warrant may—
(a) direct that any bulk personal datasets obtained or retained in reliance
on the warrant be destroyed;
(b) impose conditions as to the use or retention of any such datasets.
(4)
The Judicial Commissioner—
(a) may require an affected party to make representations about how the
Judicial Commissioner should exercise any function under subsection
(3), and
(b) must have regard to any such representations made by an affected
party (whether or not as a result of a requirement imposed under
paragraph (a)).

if anything is in the process of being done in reliance on the warrant
when it ceases to have effect—
(i) anything done before that thing could be stopped, or

statement that the case is an urgent case in which the Secretary of State has
personally expressly authorised the issue of the warrant.

State to authorise the retention or examination of any of the material, the
Judicial Commissioner must give the Secretary of State written reasons for the

the person concerned.
(4)
(5)
(6)
Accordingly, the fact that there has been a breach of a person’s Convention
rights (within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998) is not sufficient by

becomes aware is a serious error for the purposes of subsection (2)(a),
and

error to the Tribunal for decisions for the purposes of subsection (2)(b).
(7)
Before making such decisions, the Tribunal must ask (but may not require) the
public authority which has made the error to make submissions to the Tribunal
about the matters in subsection (2)(b).
(8)
When informing a person under subsection (1) of an error, the Investigatory
Powers Commissioner must—
(a) inform the person of any rights that the person may have to apply to the
Tribunal, and
(b) provide such details of the error as the Commissioner considers to be
necessary for the exercise of those rights, having regard in particular to
the extent to which disclosing the details would be contrary to the
public interest or prejudicial to anything falling within subsection
(5)(b)(i) to (iv).
(9)
(10)
(11)
The Investigatory Powers Commissioner may not inform the person to whom
it relates of a relevant error except as provided by this section.

(a) the number of relevant errors of which the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner has become aware during the year to which the report
relates,
(b) the number of references under subsection (6)(b) during that year, and
(c) the number of persons informed under subsection (1) during that year.
In this section “relevant error” means an error—
(a) by a public authority in complying with any requirements which are
imposed on it by virtue of this Act or any other enactment and which
are subject to review by a Judicial Commissioner, and
(b) of a description identified for this purpose in a code of practice under
Schedule 6,
and the Investigatory Powers Commissioner must keep under review the
definition of “relevant error”.
(1)
Additional functions under this Part
A Judicial Commissioner must give the Investigatory Powers Tribunal all such
assistance (including the Commissioner’s opinion as to any issue falling to be
determined by the Tribunal) as the Tribunal may require—
(a) in connection with the investigation of any matter by the Tribunal, or
(b) otherwise for the purposes of the Tribunal’s consideration or
determination of any matter.
(2)
A Judicial Commissioner may provide advice or information to any public
authority or other person in relation to matters for which the Judicial
Commissioners are responsible.
(3)
But a Judicial Commissioner must consult the Secretary of State before
providing any advice or information under subsection (2) if it appears to the
Commissioner that providing the advice or information might be contrary to
the public interest or prejudicial to—
(a) national security,
(b) the prevention or detection of serious crime,
(c) the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, or
(d) the continued discharge of the functions of any public authority whose
activities include activities that are subject to review by the
Investigatory Powers Commissioner.

Overview of the Bill
The Investigatory Powers Bill will provide a clear framework for the use (by the security and
intelligence agencies, law enforcement and other public authorities) of investigatory powers.
These powers cover the interception of communications, the retention and acquisition of
communications data, equipment interference for obtaining (private) data, and the security
and intelligence agencies’ acquisition of bulk personal datasets. It will not be lawful to exercise
such powers other than as provided for by the Bill.
Section 7 of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 required David Anderson
QC, in his capacity as the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, to conduct a review
of existing laws relating to investigatory powers. This Bill responds to the recommendations
made by the Independent Reviewer and those of the reviews undertaken by the Intelligence
and Security Committee of Parliament (ISC) and the Panel of the Independent Surveillance
Review convened by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). All three reviews agreed that
existing powers remain essential in tackling the current and evolving threats to the United
Kingdom.
Policy background
The Government is proposing legislation to replace the emergency legislation passed in July
2014, the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (DRIPA), which falls away on 31
December 2016. This Act replaced the Data Retention (EC Directive) Regulations 2009 (S.I.
2009/859) following the European Court of Justice judgment of April 2014 which declared the
Data Retention Directive invalid. During the passage of DRIPA, the Government committed to
bring forward new legislation to provide public authorities with the investigatory powers and
capabilities they need to address evolving threats within a changing communications
environment, as well as providing the public with clarity and reassurance about how those
powers and capabilities are used. The Investigatory Powers Bill will therefore modernise and
update the legal framework governing the state’s ability to acquire communications and data
about communications. It will consolidate existing legislation and ensure the powers in the Bill
are fit for the digital age.
The purpose of the Bill is threefold. First it will replace the existing statutory scheme with one
that is comprehensive and comprehensible. It will govern all of the powers available to the
state to access communications to provide a new statutory basis for these powers in a way that
is clear about when and how public authorities acquire, store and access information. Second,
this legislation will ensure consistent, effective statutory safeguards and will clarify which
powers different public authorities can use and for what purposes. It will set out the statutory
tests that must be met before a power may be used and will set out in detail the authorisation
regime for each investigative tool. It will remove doubt or ambiguity about the sufficiency and
efficacy of checks and balances and it will provide robust oversight arrangements. Finally, it
will enhance communications data powers in order to reinstate capabilities that have been lost
as a result of changes in the way people communicate.
This Bill is in nine parts.
Part 1 asserts the privacy of communications and provides for related offences. It defines
interception and sets out the offences of unlawful interception and unlawful acquisition of
communications data and the penalties for committing such offences. It also references the use
of powers to acquire stored communications such as an email stored on a web-based server or
a voicemail.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Part 2 provides for interception: acquiring the content of communications. This power is currently
provided for under the Regulation of the Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). The Bill will repeal
and replace the existing interception powers in Part 1, Chapter 1 of RIPA with a new targeted
interception power. It will set out the offence of unlawful interception and provide for the targeted
interception of communications by a limited number of public authorities for a limited number of
purposes when a warrant is in place. It will clarify that in all circumstances, when law enforcement or
the security and intelligence agencies wish to intercept the communications of a person believed to
be in the UK, or examine the communications of a person believed to be in the UK that have been
collected in bulk a targeted interception warrant must be sought. It also lists the other limited
circumstances in which interception (not undertaken by law enforcement or security and intelligence
agencies) can be lawful. It includes the interception powers previously provided for in the Wireless
Telegraphy Act 2006. The Bill will address the various recommendations made in respect of
interception authorisation by making the decision to issue a warrant by the Secretary of State subject
to approval by a Judicial Commissioner before the warrant comes into force.
Part 3 concerns authorisations for acquiring communications data: the ‘who’, ‘when’, ‘where’ and
‘how’ of a communication. These powers are currently primarily provided for under RIPA. The Bill
will provide powers for public authorities to acquire communications data, replacing and largely
replicating the effect of Chapter 2 of Part 1 of RIPA. The classes of communications data will be
redefined so that they reflect current technology. The Bill will require requests for communications
data to be made on a case by case basis so that access is permitted only when authorised by
designated senior officers (who will be, subject to some specific exceptions, independent from
investigations), on the advice of an expert Single Point of Contact (SPoC). Minor public authorities
will be required to share SPoCs. The individual requests must be in respect of the statutory purposes
and must be considered necessary and proportionate by a Designated Person. The Bill will set out the
public authorities that will have access to communications data in future, permitting bodies to retain
powers to access to communications data only where a clear case has been made.
Part 4 covers the retention of communications data. The existing statutory regime by which public
telecommunications operators can be required to retain communications data will be broadly
replicated, replacing section 1 of DRIPA. It will provide for the Secretary of State to require
communications service providers to retain relevant communications data for one or more of the
statutory purposes for a period that must not exceed twelve months. It specifies a number of
safeguards in respect of data retention, for example the matters that must be considered before the
giving of a retention notice, oversight arrangements and means of redress. The Bill also provides a
new power for the retention of, and access to, internet connection records (ICRs) (the records
captured by a network access provider of the internet services with which a person or device
interacts).
Part 5 concerns equipment interference: interfering with computer equipment to obtain
communications, private information or equipment data. This is currently provided for the security
and intelligence agencies under the Intelligence Services Act 1994 (ISA) and, for law enforcement
agencies under the Police Act 1997. The Bill will not repeal existing legislation but will provide a
bespoke statutory framework for the ability of the security and intelligence agencies, Armed Forces
and law enforcement agencies to undertake equipment interference to obtain communications and
other private information. Interference with equipment where the primary purpose is not to acquire
communications or private information will continue to be authorised under the Intelligence Services
Act 1994 and the Police Act 1997.
Part 6 contains powers for the security and intelligence agencies to intercept communications,
conduct equipment interference and to obtain communications data in bulk. The Bill will provide for
a new ’Bulk Acquisition’ warrant for the security and intelligence agencies to obtain communications
data. This replaces the provision at section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984, which will be
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
repealed. The Bill will allow the security and intelligence agencies to intercept communications in
bulk, focusing on the communications of persons who are believed to be outside the UK. This will
replace the power to intercept ‚external communications‛ in Chapter 1, Part 1 of RIPA. Where it is
not necessary to obtain the content of such communications, the Bill will provide the Secretary of
State with the power to issue, subject to Judicial Commissioner approval, a warrant for the
acquisition of related communications data only. The warrant will also pre-authorise the purposes for
which communications acquired under a bulk warrant may be examined. A bulk equipment
interference power will provide the statutory basis for foreign-focused equipment interference
activity undertaken by the security and intelligence agencies. All bulk powers will be underpinned by
safeguards equivalent to the bulk interception regime for the handling, destruction and retention of
information.
12 Part 7 provides clarity and additional safeguards for the security and intelligence agencies’
acquisition and use of Bulk Personal Datasets (BPD). The security and intelligence agencies
have existing statutory powers under ISA and the Security Service Act 1989 (SSA) which
enable them to acquire and access datasets containing personal data about a large number of
individuals, many of whom are not of interest to the agencies. The Bill will not create a new
power but bring greater transparency to this important capability and provide for enhanced
safeguards. Acquisition and use of bulk personal data by the security and intelligence agencies
will be subject to an authorisation process where the Secretary of State will issue a either a
‘class’ or ‘specific’ warrant which must then be approved by a Judicial Commissioner before it
can come into force.
13 Part 8 sets out new oversight regime arrangements which will replace the three existing
commissioners (the Intelligence Services Commissioner, the Interception of Communications
Commissioner and the Chief Surveillance Commissioner) with a single new commissioner, the
Investigatory Powers Commissioner (IPC). The Investigatory Powers Commissioner, a senior
judge, will be supported by a number of Judicial Commissioners undertaking either
authorisation or oversight and inspection functions. The Investigatory Powers Commissioner
will have significantly greater powers and resources compared to the current oversight regime.
The IPC will be a more visible body, providing robust oversight and scrutiny of the use of
investigatory powers by a wide range of public authorities. The Investigatory Powers
Commissioner will be able to draw on extensive legal and technical expertise. The
Investigatory Powers Commissioner will have to report annually and be able to make ad hoc
reports on matters that they consider appropriate.
14 The Bill will also create a domestic right of appeal in relation to decisions of the Investigatory
Powers Tribunal (IPT) to the Court of Appeal. Regulations will make provision for claims
relating to a devolved matter in Northern Ireland and Scotland in cases where the IPT has
made a determination and found there is a point of law at issue. The Bill will enable appeals to
be heard wholly or partly in closed material proceedings (CMP), if it is necessary for the appeal
court to review information which was considered by the IPT in closed session. The Bill will
provide for statutory Codes of Practice providing further guidance on the powers and duties in
the Bill, to which public authorities and providers must have regard when carrying out these
powers and duties.
15 Part 9 contains General and Final Provisions. This includes provision relating to obligations
that may be placed on communications service providers to assist in giving effect to warrants
and authorisations under the Bill as well as providing a new framework for obligations
previously provided for under s.94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984.
Legal background
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
16 The investigatory powers available to the security and intelligence agencies, law enforcement
and other public authorities are currently contained in a number of pieces of legislation. These
powers include the interception of communications, the retention and acquisition of
communications data, equipment interference, and the acquisition of bulk data.
17 The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) contains much of the current
legislative scheme governing the investigatory powers used by the security and intelligence
and law enforcement agencies to interfere with communications, and was intended to provide
an ECHR-compliant framework. Part 1 concerns communications. Chapter 1 of Part 1 concerns
the interception of communications in the course of their transmission. It provides that such
interception is an offence if carried out without lawful authority, and sets out the
circumstances in which interception may be lawful. It also provides for the circumstances in
which the Secretary of State may issue warrants for the interception of communications, and
protections for intercepted material. Chapter 2 of Part 1 concerns powers to acquire
communications data (information concerning a communication, but not its content) from
communications service providers. It sets out the public authorities who may acquire such data
and the purposes for which they may do so, and the procedure for the authorisation of such
conduct.
18 Part 4 contains oversight measures, providing for the Interception of Communications
Commissioner, the Intelligence Services Commissioner and giving additional powers to the
Surveillance Commissioner established under the Police Act 1997. Part 4 also establishes the
Investigatory Powers Tribunal.
19 Sections 1 - 2 of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (DRIPA) and the Data
Retention Regulations 2014 (DRR) contain the legislative scheme concerning the power of the
Secretary of State to require communications service providers to retain communications data.
DRIPA also made clear the extra-territorial extent of Part 1 of RIPA. Part 3 of the
Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 (CTSA) amends DRIPA so that an additional
category of data - that necessary to resolve Internet Protocol addresses – can be included in a
requirement to retain data. DRIPA contains a sunset clause and sections 1-7 are repealed on 31
December 2016. Part 11 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 provides for a
voluntary code of conduct concerning the retention of communications data.
20 The Security Service Act 1989 (SSA) sets out the functions of the Security Service, and provides
that the Service can only obtain or disclose information so far as is necessary for those
functions.
21 The Intelligence Services Act 1994 (ISA) sets out the functions of the Secret Intelligence Service
and GCHQ, and contains similar provision concerning the obtaining and disclosure of
information. Section 5 provides for the Secretary of State to authorise interference with
property or wireless telegraphy where necessary for assisting the carrying out of any of the
three Agencies’ functions. Section 7 provides for the Secretary of State to authorise activities
overseas that would otherwise incur civil or criminal liability, where necessary for the proper
discharge of the functions of SIS or GCHQ. These powers are currently used to authorise
certain activities of the Agencies that will be included in the new legislation.
22 Part 3 of the Police Act 1997 provides for the authorisation of interference with property or
with wireless telegraphy. It also provides for the appointment of Surveillance Commissioners,
who are given additional powers by Part 4 of RIPA.
23 The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (sections 49) provides for the authorisation of the use of
wireless telegraphy equipment to obtain information about a communication, or the disclosure

of such information. Such conduct is otherwise an offence under section 48 of the Act.
24 Section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 gives the Secretary of State power to issue a
direction of a general character to OFCOM or to a communications provider, in the interests of
national security or international relations. Such directions may be kept secret.
European law
25 Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy
in the telecommunications sector (‘the e-Privacy Directive’) contains a general requirement of
confidentiality of electronic communications, as well as requirements to delete traffic data
when no longer needed, and other protections for electronic communications. Art 15(1)
provides that Member States may derogate from certain rights in the directive (including the
right to privacy) where this is a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a
democratic society to safeguard national security, defence, public security, the prevention,
detection of crime and the purposes laid down in Art 13 of the Data Protection Directive. Art
15(1) specifically provides for the retention of communications data.
26 Directive 2006/24/EC (‘the Data Retention Directive’) harmonised the retention of
communications data. The Data Retention Directive was struck down as incompatible with
Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in joined cases C-293/12 and C-594/12
Digital Rights Ireland & Seitlinger, on the basis that it did not contain sufficient safeguards. No
replacement Directive has as yet been proposed.
Territorial extent and application
27 The provisions in this Bill extend to the whole of the United Kingdom.

Commentary on provisions of Bill
Part 1: General Protections
Clause 1: Overview of the Act
29 This clause is self-explanatory.
Clause 2: Offence of unlawful interception
30 Subsection (1) makes it an offence to intentionally intercept, in the United Kingdom, a
communication in the course of its transmission without lawful authority. This applies to a
public telecommunications system, private telecommunications system or a public postal
service. This is the same offence which previously existed under the RIPA.
31 Subsection (2) confirms that the criminal offence in subsection (1) does not apply where a
person has the right to control the operation or use of the system or has the expressed or
implied consent of such a person to carry out the interception. This is relevant to computer
networks in the home or workplace.
32 Subsections (3), (4) and (5) signpost the sections of the Bill which define interception and when
this is understood to be taking place in the UK; definitions of public telecommunications
system, private telecommunications system and public postal service; and who has the lawful
authority to apply for an interception warrant. A public telecommunications system is the
hardware and software used to provide a telecommunications service to the public in the
United Kingdom. A private telecommunications system is one that is separate from, but
connected to a public telecommunications system; this will include computer networks in the
home or workplace.
33 Subsection (6) sets out the penalties for a person who is found guilty of the offence of unlawful
interception under section 1. The penalty for unlawful interception replicates the penalty
which existed under RIPA.
34 Subsection (7) provides that any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) must be with
the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions (in England and Wales) or the Director of
Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland (in Northern Ireland).
Clause 3: Definition of ‚interception‛ etc
35 This clause defines interception in relation to a telecommunication system and sets out when
interception is understood to take place in the United Kingdom. The intention is to make clear
which actions constitute interception.
36 Subsection (1) explains that a person must undertake one or more ‘relevant acts’ (set out in
subsection (2)) at a ‘relevant time’, the consequence of which is to make some or all of the
content of a communication available to a person who is not the sender or intended recipient.
37 Subsection (3) gives more detail of the relevant act of modifying a telecommunications system.
38 Subsections (4) and (5) define what is meant by ‘relevant time’. The intention of subsection
(4)(b) is to make clear that a communication is still considered in the course of its transmission
when it is stored in or by the system used to transmit it. A stored communication includes
communications stored on phones, tablets and other individual devices.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Example:
An email which has been sent and is stored on an email server or a
voicemail message which has been stored on a telecommunications
system to be retrieved later.
39 Subsection (8) makes clear when interception takes place in the United Kingdom.
Clause 4: Conduct that is not interception
40 The purpose of clause 4 is to set out conduct which does not constitute interception. Subsection
(1) makes clear that interception of a communication broadcast for general reception is not
interception within the context of this Bill. Subsection (2) excludes conduct in relation to 'postal
data’ attached to the communication. Clause 194 provides provide further information on the
references to postal data.
Clause 5: Definition of ‚lawful authority‛
41 This clause sets out the circumstances in which a person has lawful authority to carry out
interception, so an offence of unlawful interception is not committed. Subsection (1) sets out
that lawful authority to carry out interception must be either: in accordance with a warrant;
with consent or, in relation to stored communications, the exercise of any statutory power for
the purpose of obtaining information or taking possession of any document or other property.
Clause 6: Monetary Penalties for certain unlawful interceptions
42 This clause provides for the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to impose fines where
unlawful interception has taken place but where the person responsible was not intending to
intercept a communication.
Example:
A company that develops and uses a piece of software to collect
information about Wi-Fi hotspots but does not realise that it is also
intercepting content which is being sent from non-secure Wi-Fi devices.
43 Subsections (3) and (4) set out the conditions which must be met for the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner to issue a monetary penalty notice. The Investigatory Powers Commissioner
may not issue a monetary penalty notice if he or she considers that the person has committed
an offence of unlawful interception i.e. the interception was intentional.
44 Subsection (6) introduces Schedule 1 which makes further provision about monetary penalty
notices.
Clause 7: Restrictions on requesting overseas interception
45 This clause explains that a mutual assistance warrant must be in place before a request for
interception can be made to authorities outside the UK under a mutual assistance agreement.
Subsection (3) sets out the meaning of ‚international mutual assistance agreement‛and "EU
mutual assistance instrument".
Clause 8: Offence of unlawfully obtaining communications data
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
46 Clause 8 creates a new offence of unlawfully obtaining communications data. It is intended to
act as a deterrent and provide reassurance that abuse of communications data will be
punished.
Clause 9: Abolition of certain powers to obtain data
47 This clause and Schedule 2 restrict general information gathering powers and certain specific
pieces of legislation being used to acquire communications data. The intent of these provisions
is to ensure that this Bill, with its associated safeguards, is the only route for the acquisition of
communications data for the statutory purposes in this Bill.
48 Numerous pieces of legislation provide public authorities with powers to require information
in certain circumstances. This clause ensures those pieces of legislation will no longer be able to
be used to acquire communications data.
49 Clause 9 does not apply where the power relates to communications data or the regulation of
telecommunications services. This is to allow OFCOM and the Information Commissioner’s
Office to carry out legitimate regulatory functions, for example ensuring the radio spectrum is
used in an effective way.
50 Schedule 2 lists the powers that specifically reference communications data or
telecommunications services that are being repealed.
Clause 10: Mandatory use of targeted equipment interference warrants
51 This clause sets out the conditions in which a warrant must be sought under the powers
contained in the Bill before equipment interference can be carried out by a relevant service
which includes the intelligence agencies and Ministry of Defence.
52 Subsections (1) (a) and (b) state that the activity must both be believed to constitute one or
more offences under sections 1 to 3A of the Computer Misuse Act 1990, and have a connection
to the British Islands.
53 Subsection (2) defines British Islands as either:
a.
Where the proposed activity would take place in the UK (regardless of where the
equipment to be interfered with is located). When the intelligence agencies or
Ministry of Defence are operating from the UK, they must use this act to authorise
their activity even if the equipment itself leaves or does not enter the UK;
b.
or where the intelligence service or Ministry of Defence believes the equipment to be
interfered with may be located in the UK at some point during the interference itself.
This will include circumstances where the computer is located in the UK or is carried
by someone transiting through the UK at the time the interference is taking place;
c.
or where the purpose of the interference is to enable the acquisition of the private
information or the communications sent to or from a person believed to be in the UK.
The interference is aimed at a person in the UK.
54 Subsection (3) clarifies that where those conditions are not met, an intelligence service or
Ministry of Defence may still apply for an equipment interference warrant. The
circumstances in which they would do so will be set out in Codes of Practice.
Clause 11: Restriction on use of section 93 of the Police Act 1997
55 This clause confirms that applications may not be made under section 93 of the Police Act for
activity that would be authorised by a targeted equipment interference warrant (in other
words where the primary aim of the equipment interference is to obtain communications etc.)
if the applicant believes it constitutes an offence under the Computer Misuse Act. This does not
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
remove or otherwise limit the ability for equipment interference to be authorised under the
Police Act 1997 where the primary aim is not to obtain communications, private information or
equipment data.
Part 2: Lawful Interception of Communications
Chapter 1: Interception and examination with a warrant
Clause 12: Warrants that may be issued under this Chapter
56 Subsection (1) explains that there are three types of warrants which can be issued under this
chapter. Subsection (2) describes a targeted interception warrant. Subsection (3) describes a
targeted examination warrant which authorises the examination of material that has been
collected under a bulk interception warrant. Examination warrants must be sought whenever a
member of an intelligence service wishes to look at material which relates to a person who is
believed to be in the British Islands and when he or she believes that it is necessary and
proportionate to select the content of that person’s communications for examination.
57 Subsection (4) describes a mutual assistance warrant which would be made to EU or non-EU
authorities requesting assistance in relation to the intelligence request specified in the warrant.
58 Subsection (5) confirms that a warrant authorises any conduct necessary to fulfill what is
required by the warrant, including interception of communications not specifically described
in the warrant or related communications data.
59 Subsections (6)-(9) define what is related communications data in relation to a targeted
interception warrant. Related communications data includes:
a.
Communications data (see clause 193);
b.
Data obtained through a warrant which enables or otherwise facilitates the functioning
of any postal service, telecommunications system or any telecommunications service
provided by means of the system;
c.
Data which:
i. Can be logically extracted from the content of the communication;
ii. Which does not, once extracted, reveal the meaning of the content of the
communication; and
iii. Can identify, or assist in identifying, any person, apparatus,
telecommunication system or telecommunications service, or which describes
an event, or the location of any person, event or thing.
60 Related communications data as defined in this clause may only be obtained under a targeted
interception warrant and, once the data is obtained, will be subject to the safeguards set out in
Part 2.
61 Related communications data obtained under a targeted interception warrant is equivalent to
related communications data obtained under a bulk interception warrant, and equipment data
obtained pursuant to an equipment interference warrant.
62 This clause makes clear that the extraction of any data from the content of a communication
that has been acquired during the course of its transmission can only take place under an
interception warrant.
63 In addition to communications data the data falling within this category could include:
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
a.
The version of the app sending the message;
b.
Data relating to any files attached to a message such as the date and time it was created
and the author;
c.
Any location information related to the communication, for example the location
required to enable an application;
d. Any email addresses contained within a communication
Clause 13: Subject-matter of warrants
64 Subsection (1) sets out that a warrant under this Chapter may relate to a particular person or
organisation, or a single set of premises. Subsection (2) provides further detail on when a
warrant may apply to a group of persons or more than one set of premises.
Clause 14: Power of Secretary of State to issue warrants
65 This clause provides a power for the Secretary of State to issue a Part 2 warrant. Subsections (1)
and (2) require that the Secretary of State considers that the targeted interception, mutual
assistance or examination warrant is necessary (for the purposes set out in subsection (3)) and
proportionate to what is sought to be achieved. The decision of the Secretary of State to issue
the warrant must then be approved by a Judicial Commissioner before the warrant comes into
force.
66 Subsection (3) sets out the grounds on which a Part 2 warrant can be applied for. These are the
interest of national security, preventing or detecting serious crime, safeguarding the economic
well-being of the United Kingdom (in circumstances relevant to the interests of national
security), or giving effect to the provisions of any international mutual assistance agreement.
67 Subsection (4) clarifies that a warrant authorised on grounds of being in the economic
well-being of the UK can only be sought to obtain information relating to acts or persons
outside of the UK.
68 Subsection (6) requires the Secretary of State to consider whether the information thought
necessary to obtain under a warrant could be sought by other means. Subsection (7) provides
the circumstances under which the Secretary of State may not issue a warrant under this
section i.e. if it relates to serious crime activity in Scotland.
Clause 15: Persons who may apply for issue of a warrant
69 Clause 15 lists those persons who may apply to the Secretary of State for an interception
warrant. The same people may apply for a warrant as was the case under RIPA.
Clause 16: Additional protection for Members of Parliament, etc
70 This clause requires the Secretary of State to consult the Prime Minister before deciding to issue
a targeted interception or examination warrant where the purpose may be to obtain the
communications of a person who is a member of a relevant legislature. Subsection (3) defines
"member of a relevant legislature‛.
Clause 17: Power of Scottish Ministers to issue warrants
71 This clause provides a power for the Scottish Ministers to issue a Part 2 warrant. Subsections
(1) and (2) require that the Scottish Ministers consider that the warrant is necessary (for the
purposes set out in subsection (3)) and proportionate to what is sought to be achieved. The
decision of the Scottish Ministers to issue the warrant must then be approved by a Judicial
Commissioner before the warrant comes into force.
Clause 18: "Relevant Scottish applications"
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
72 Subsections (2) – (4) set out the conditions that need to be met for a warrant application under
this Chapter to be considered as a "relevant Scottish application". These are where the
application relates to a person reasonably believed to be in Scotland or premises which are in
Scotland; or if the application is made by or on behalf of the Chief Constable of Police Scotland,
the Commissioner of HM Revenue and Customs or the Director General of the National Crime
Agency for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime in Scotland.
Clause 19: Approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioner
73 This clause sets out the test that the Judicial Commissioner must follow when looking at
whether to approve a decision to issue a warrant. They must look at the necessity and
proportionality test applied by the Secretary of State under clause 14 in relation to the same
grounds that the court would apply for a judicial review.
74 Subsection (4) makes clear that where a Commissioner refuses to approve a warrant they must
set out written reasons for their refusal. This may allow the agency requesting the warrant to
reconsider their application and what action they are seeking to take in order to meet any
concerns expressed by the Commissioner.
75 Subsection (5) sets out that a Secretary of State or Scottish Ministers may ask the Investigatory
Powers Commissioner to reconsider an application that a Judicial Commissioner has refused.
Should the Investigatory Powers Commissioner also refuse to approve the warrant there is no
further right of appeal and the warrant cannot come into force.
Clause 20: Approval of warrants in urgent cases
76 This clause sets out the process for issuing a warrant in urgent cases. If the person issuing the
warrant deems the warrant to be urgent then in extremis it can be issued without the approval
of a Judicial Commissioner. Subsection (2) requires that the issuing of the warrant must be
notified to the Judicial Commissioner. Subsection (3) provides that the Commissioner must
decide whether to approve the decision to issue the warrant within five working days.
Subsection (4) makes clear that this requirement for the Judicial Commissioner to approve the
urgent warrant falls away if the warrant is to be renewed within the five working day period.
In those circumstance the Judicial Commissioner will approve the warrant renewal in the usual
way
77 If the Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve the urgent warrant within the five day period
then subsection (5) provides that the warrant ceases to have effect. Subsection (6) refers the
reader to the part of the Bill that contains further provision about what happens in these
circumstances.
Clause 21: Warrants ceasing to have effect under section 20
78 If a Judicial Commissioner (or on appeal, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner), refuses to
approve a warrant that has been approved under the urgency procedure then the warrant
ceases to have effect. Subsection (2) outlines how those exercising powers under the warrant
must, as far and as quickly as they can, stop any activity being undertaken.
79 Subsection (3) sets out how the Judicial Commissioner can determine what can happen to any
material or intelligence gathered under an urgent warrant that they have declined to approve.
Subsection (4) provides for representations to be made to the Judicial Commissioner from
those involved in applying for the warrant or carrying out activity under the authority of the
warrant.
80 Subsections (6) and (7) provide for the Secretary of State or Scottish Minister who authorised
the warrant to ask the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to review a decision of a Judicial
Commissioner to refuse an urgent warrant and provides that he can confirm the Judicial
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Commissioner’s decision or make a fresh determination.
81 Subsection (8) provides that any activity carried out before the Judicial Commissioner refused
to authorise the warrant remains lawful, as is anything that cannot practically be stopped.
Clause 22: Decisions to issue warrants to be taken personally by Ministers
82 Subsection (1) requires the decision to issue a warrant under Chapter 2 to be taken personally
by the Secretary of State or a member of the Scottish Government. Subsection (2) requires the
warrant to be signed by the person who has taken the decision to issue the warrant (except in
urgent cases). Subsections (4) to (6) provide that in urgent cases a warrant may be signed by a
senior official designated by a Secretary of State or Scottish Minister.
Clause 23: Requirements that must be met by warrants
83 This clause deals with the information which needs to be contained in Part 2 warrants.
Subsections (2) to (9) specify the information a warrant must contain including the intercepting
authority, details of the person or group of persons, organisation or premises to which the
warrant relates. In the case where the warrant relates to a group of individuals linked by an
activity/investigation/operation, this must be described.
Example:
This involves an operation where an individual has been kidnapped. The
agency may have a phone number or numbers but at the time not know
who they are being used by. In these circumstances the agency could not
describe the individuals (beyond kidnapper 1, kidnapper 2, driver etc.).
The warrant could therefore refer to operation ‘safe return’ and would
allow an addition if the investigation then becomes aware of ‘kidnapper
3’.
Clause 24: Duration of warrants
84 This clause deals with the duration of a Part 2 warrant. An interception warrant will last for 6
months (unless it is cancelled earllier). If the warrant is not renewed it will cease to have effect
after that period. Urgent warrants will last for 5 days unless renewed.
Clause 25: Renewal of warrants
85 Subsections (1) - (3) state that a warrant may be renewed by an instrument issued by the
appropriate person. The appropriate person is set out at subsection (3). In order to renew the
warrant the appropriate person must consider that it is still necessary. As with an application
for an interception warrant, the decision to renew the warrant must also be reviewed by a
Judicial Commissioner prior to the date of expiry. The clause also sets out the additional
protection for Members of Parliament, etc. (see 16(3)), that apply in relation to a decision to
renew a warrant as it applies in relation to a decision to issue a warrant.
Clause 26: Modification of warrants
86 This clause provides for a warrant to be modified as specified in subsection (2) by instrument.
Subsection (4) explains what ‚major‛ and ‚minor‛ modifications are and subsections (5) and
(6) outline who can undertake a major and minor modification. Subsections (8)-(11) restate
the conditions of necessity and proportionality which must be considered before major
modifications can be made. The clause also sets out the additional protection for Members of
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Parliament, etc. (see 16(3)), that apply in relation to a decision to make a major modification
of a warrant as it applies in relation to a decision to issue a warrant.
Clause 27: Cancellation of warrants
87 This clause provides that the Secretary of State, Scottish Ministers, a member of the Scottish
Government or a senior official acting on their behalf may cancel a warrant if it is no longer
necessary.
Clause 28: Special rules for certain mutual assistance warrants
88 This clause deals with the process for providing assistance in relation to a mutual assistance
agreement or instrument. This applies to applications to provide assistance with intercepting
the communications of an individual outside the United Kingdom or in relation to premises
outside the United Kingdom.
89 Subsection (2) provides that the decision to provide assistance in such circumstances can be
taken by a senior official designated by the Secretary of State. Subsection (4) makes clear that
the senior official may also renew the mutual assistance warrant. Subsections (3) and (5) set
out what must be included in the warrant. Subsection (7) makes clear that any warrant must
be cancelled if the subject of the warrant is in the UK.
Clause 29: Implementation of warrants
90 This clause requires the person on whom a targeted interception warrant or mutual assistance
warrant is served to give effect to the warrant. Subsections (3, 4 and 6) make clear that a copy of
a warrant may be served on any person who the implementing authority believes may be able
to provide assistance to give effect to the warrant; that a copy can be served on a person
outside the UK and that copies of the warrant itself or one or more of the schedules contained
in the warrant may be served. Subsection (5) defines that provision of assistance requires the
disclosure of interception and related communications data authorised by the warrant.
Clause 30: Service of warrants
91 This clause sets out the process for serving an interception warrant. Subsection (2) and (3) set
out how an interception warrant may be served on a person outside the UK.
Clause 31: Duty of operators to assist with implementation
92 This clause sets out the obligation placed on service providers to give effect to a warrant and
makes clear the steps they must take to give effect to it. Subsection (3) requires a relevant
provider to give effect to a targeted interception warrant whether or not the provider is in the
UK. Subsection (4) ensures that the steps a service provider is required to make must be
reasonably practicable and subsection (5) makes clear that in considering what is reasonable,
any requirements or restrictions under the laws of the country in which a provider is based
must be taken into account.
93 Subsection (7) sets out the offence for knowingly failing to comply with an interception
warrant. Subsection (8) provides that the duty to comply with a warrant is enforceable by civil
proceedings brought by the Secretary of State.
Chapter 2: Other forms of lawful interception
Clause 32: Interception with the consent of the sender or recipient
94 Subsection (1) confirms that the interception of a communication is authorised if both the
person sending the communication and the intended recipient of the communication have
given consent for the interception to take place.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
95 Subsection (2) confirms that the interception of a communication is authorised if either the
sender or the intended recipient has consented and surveillance has been authorised under
Part 2 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.
Example:
This situation might arise where a kidnapper is telephoning relatives of a
hostage, and the police wish to listen to the call in order to identify or
trace the kidnapper. The operation will be authorised as surveillance,
rather than by means of an interception warrant, because consent can
only reasonably be obtained for one end of the communications i.e. the
relatives have consented.
Clause 33: Interception by providers of postal or telecommunication services
96 This clause authorises interception where it takes place for the purpose of providing or
operating a postal service or telecommunications service, or where any enactment relating to
the use of such a service is to be enforced. This might occur, for example, where the postal
provider needs to open a postal item to determine the address of the sender because the
recipient’s address is unknown. A further example might be where a telecommunications
service provider is delivering a service to its customers and the customer has requested that
harmful, illegal or adult content is filtered (e.g. family friendly filtering).
97 Subsection (3) makes clear that telecommunication service providers can undertake activity to
protect the telecommunication system through which their service is provided and any
apparatus attached to that system, to maintain the integrity of their services and to ensure the
security of their customers.
Clause 34: Interception by businesses, etc for monitoring and record-keeping
purposes
98 This clause allows for the making of regulations by the Secretary of State to authorise
legitimate practice to carry out relevant activities. This clause will allow the Secretary of State
to make regulations authorising the monitoring or keeping of records of communications,
where that is a legitimate business practice required for business purposes.
Example:
The recording of telephone conversations by businesses for training or
quality control purposes.
Clause 35: Postal Services: interception for enforcement purposes
99 This clause provides for the interception of postal items by HM Revenue and Customs in
carrying out their duties under clause 159 of the Customs and Excise Act 1979 or by an
examining officer under paragraph 9 of Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
Clause 36: Interception by OFCOM in connection with wireless telegraphy
100 This clause states that the interception of communications is authorised with the authority of
OFCOM under section 48 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 in their efforts to maintain the
security of the radio frequency network.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
101 Subsection (3) sets out the purposes for which OFCOM can use wireless telegraphy to intercept
communications.
Clause 37: Interception in prisons
102 Subsection (1) makes clear that it is lawful to intercept communications in a prison if it is in the
exercise of any power conferred under prison rules and subsections (2 and 3) sets out what is
meant by ‚prison rules‛ and ‚prisons‛.
Clause 38: Interception in psychiatric hospitals
103 This clause sets out the circumstances in which interception can be carried out in psychiatric
hospitals.
Clause 39: Interception in accordance with overseas requests
104 This clause deals with the issue of interception when a request is made from overseas.
105 Subsections (2) – (5) sets out the conditions which need to be met in order that a
communications provider may intercept the communications of an individual outside the UK
at the request of another country. Further conditions may be contained in regulations made by
the Secretary of State.
Chapter 3 – Other provisions about interception
Clause 40: General safeguards
106 This clause sets out that the issuing authority must ensure that arrangements are in force for
safeguarding material obtained under an interception warrant.
107 Subsection (2) sets out the requirements to keep to a minimum the number of persons who see
material and to limit the disclosure and number of copies made of any material to the
minimum necessary for the authorised purposes. Subsection (3) sets out the circumstances in
which something is necessary for the authorised purposes.
108 Subsections (4) to (6) require that material is kept in a secure manner and that it must be
destroyed as soon as it is no longer required for any authorised purpose.
Clause 41: Safeguards relating to disclosure of material or data overseas
109 This clause sets out the safeguards which apply when disclosing intercept material and related
communications data to an overseas authority. These include that material is not disclosed in a
way which would constitute unlawful disclosure in the United Kingdom.
Clause 42: Exclusion of matters from legal proceedings
110 This clause prevents intercept material being used or disclosed in legal proceedings or
Inquiries Act proceedings. This includes adducing it in evidence, asking questions about it,
disclosing it, or doing anything from which it could be inferred that the material came from
interception or which suggests that interception may have occurred. Subsection (2) defines
‚interception related conduct‛ and the other statutes that apply
111 The exceptions to this prohibition are set out in Schedule 2.
Clause 43: Duty not to make unauthorised disclosures
112 This clause places a duty on those persons listed in subsection (3) not to disclose the existence
or details of a warrant or any intercepted material. Subsection (4) sets out the matters which, if
disclosed, would constitute unauthorised disclosure. Subsection (5) sets out the circumstances
in which disclosure would be authorised. It also makes clear that operators may disclose
information relating to the number of warrants they have given effect to and subsection (7)
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
provides for the Secretary of State to issue directions relating that disclosure.
Clause 44: Offence of making unauthorised disclosures
113 This clause provides that it is an offence to fail to comply with the duty in clause 43 and sets
out the penalty for unlawful disclosure of intercept material.
Clause 45: Part 2: interpretation
114 This clause sets out definitions for a number of terms used throughout this clause.
Part 3: Authorisations for obtaining communications data
Clause 46: Power to grant authorisations
115 This clause provides the power for relevant public authorities to acquire communications data.
An authorisation can be granted where a designated person in a relevant public authority is
content that a request is necessary and proportionate for one of the 10 purposes set out in
subsection (7). Communications data cannot be acquired in circumstances outside of those
purposes and only certain authorities can use certain purposes, as outlined in Schedule 4.
116 Subsection (4) provides for some of the conduct which an authorisation may permit for the
purpose of acquiring communications data. The types of conduct that can be engaged in are
the same as can currently under Chapter 2 Part 1 of RIPA. For example the conduct to acquire
communications data may involve:
a.
Serving a notice on a telecommunications service provider that requires them to
disclose the relevant data;
b.
Serving a notice on a telecommunications service provider that requests they obtain
and then disclose the relevant data;
c.
A relevant public authority acquiring the data directly from a communications service
provider through a secure auditable system
117 Subsection (5) provides examples may be covered by an authorisation. For example, an
authorisation may cover data that is not in existence at the time of the authorisation. This
allows a relevant public authority to request communications data on a forward looking basis
in respect of a known subject of interests. It also provides that an authorisation can authorise
the disclosure of communications data by a communications service provider through a secure
auditable system.
Clause 47: Additional restrictions on grant of authorisations
118 This clause provides a restriction on who can authorise the request. The authorising officer can
only agree to the acquisition of communications data where they are independent of the
operation.
119 Examples of this relate to cases where there is an imminent threat to life, where using an
independent authorising officer would immediately impact on national security or where it is
simply not possible due to the size of the public authority.
120 This clause also provides restrictions concerning the acquisition of internet connection records
that are held by communications service providers. Under RIPA there are currently no such
restrictions, however communications service providers cannot be required to retain internet
connection records under existing legislation. Clause 71(9)(f) of this Bill provides for the
retention of internet connection records. A public authority may only acquire internet
connection records that are held by a communications service provider for the following three
purposes:
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
a.
To identify the sender of an online communication; this will often be in the form of IP
address resolution and the internet service used must be known in advance of the
application.
b.
Identifying which communication services a person has been using, for example
determining whether they are communicating through apps on their phone.
c.
Identifying where a person has accessed illegal content, for example an internet service
hosting child abuse imagery.
121 In practice, in respect of purpose a., the relevant public authority will be aware of an action on
a particular internet service at a specific time or range of time, for example that illegal images
have been uploaded. The communications data application would be to determine which
individual carried out that action at that time.
122 In respect of purposes b. and c., the designated senior officer within a relevant public authority
could only approve the application if it was to determine how an individual has been
communicating with another individual online, or whether they had been accessing illegal
material over a specified timeframe. In practice, if approved, a request would then be made to
a communications service provider for all internet connection records in that timeframe.
123 Local authorities will be prohibited from acquiring internet connection records for any purpose.
Clause 48: Procedure for authorisations and authorised notices
124 Subsection (1) sets out that every authorisation must specify certain details. These include the
position held by the designated senior officer granting the authorisation, which of the limited
purposes it is being granted for (as set out in Clause 46(7)), the conduct for which it was
authorised, the type of data to be obtained, and who the data will be disclosed to.
125 Subsection (2) sets out that an authorisation which authorises a person to place an obligation
on a communications service provider to acquire communications data must specify the name
of the communications service provider and the requirements that will be imposed on that
communications service provider.
126 Subsection (3) sets out that the notice must specify the position held by the person giving the
notice, the requirements that will be imposed on that communications service provider, and
the name of the communications service provider.
127 Subsection 4 sets out that a record must be kept of the notice in order to show that it has been
applied for or granted.
Clause 49: Duration and cancellation of authorisations and notices
128 Clause 49 limits the duration of authorisations and sets out when they must be cancelled.
Subsection (1) provides that an authorisation ceases to have effect at the end of the period of
one month beginning from the date it was granted.
129 Subsections (2) and (3) permit an authorisation to be renewed at any period during the month,
by following the same procedure as for obtaining a fresh authorisation. The renewed
authorisation will last for a period of one month from the date the current authorisation
expires.
130 Subsection (4) places a duty on the designated senior officer who has granted an authorisation
to cancel it if they are satisfied that the position is no longer as set out clause 46(1).
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
131 Subsections (5) and (6) permit the Secretary of State to specify by order the person required to
carry out the duty set out in subsection (4) in the event that this would otherwise fall on a
person who is no longer available to perform it.
Clause 50: Duties of telecommunications operators in relation to authorisations
132 Communications service providers are required to comply with a request for communications
data, unless in circumstances where it is not reasonably practicable to comply. If complying
with the request is reasonably practicable then the provider should comply in such a way that
involves processing the minimum amount of data necessary.
133 Subsection (1) places a duty on communications service providers which are under a notice to
comply with authorised requests for data.
134 Subsection (2) places a duty on a communications service provider who is obtaining or
disclosing communications data in response to a request or a requirement to carry out these
activities in a way that minimises the amount of data that needs to be processed for the
purpose concerned.
135 Subsection (3) sets out that a person on whom duties in subsections (1) and (2) are placed is not
required to do anything in pursuance of this duty that it is not reasonably practicable to do.
136 Subsection (4) specifies that the duties imposed by subsections (1) or (2) are enforceable by the
Secretary of State by civil proceedings for an injunction, or for the specific performance of a
statutory duty under clause 45 of the Court of Session Act 1988 or for any other appropriate
relief.
Clause 51: Filtering arrangements for obtaining data
137 This clause provides a power to establish filtering arrangements to facilitate the lawful,
efficient and effective obtaining of communications data by relevant public authorities and to
assist a designated senior officer in each public authority to determine whether he believes the
tests for granting an authorisation to obtain data have been met. The filtering arrangements
will minimise the interference with the right to privacy, in particular respect for personal
correspondence, to which requests for internet based communications data will give rise
thereby ensuring that privacy is properly protected. In practice, filtering arrangements would
be implemented by the Secretary of State in a Request Filter system which would be used by
public authorities granting authorisations for the targeted acquisition of communications data.
Potential use of the Request Filter
Example (1): IP address resolution:
An investigator has details of a number of IP addresses which they
believe relate to a specific individual, and have been used to access
internet services at known times. However, each IP address cannot be
resolved to a single individual because at the known time it has been
simultaneously shared between many internet users. In this example the
Request Filter would be able to match the specific individual in common
between the users of each the IP addresses, then disclose only the
communications data about that specific individual to the public
authority. Without the Request Filter telecommunications operators
would need to disclose details of every individual that had shared the IP
addresses at the relevant times, and an analyst working in the public
authority would examine all of the individuals data to obtain the same
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
result.
Example (2): Location correlation:
If an investigator knows that a person of interest has been in a number of
places at certain times. The Request Filter would enable them to
determine whether communications service providers retained
information that can identify the specific individual that matched being in
those locations. Without the Request Filter the data of every individual
that matched each location would have to be disclosed and the law
enforcement agency would need to correlate the data.
138 These type of applications, as all communications data applications, would only be able to be
made where necessary and proportionate.
139 The power to establish filtering arrangements in subsection (1) operates solely in the context of
Part 3 of the Bill which creates a regulatory regime for obtaining data. The power is intended
to facilitate the obtaining of data by public authorities only for the purpose of a specific
investigation or a specific operation in accordance with an authorisation, whilst protecting
privacy. Any communications data obtained by the filtering arrangements must be
immediately deleted once the purposes of the authorisation have been met. The power will be
exercised in two main ways.
Clause 52: Use of filtering arrangements in pursuance of an authorisation
140 Clause 52 will apply in relation to the use of any Request Filter established under the power in
clause 51. The effect of subsection (2) is that the Request Filter may be used to obtain, process
and disclose Part 3 data if, but only if, these uses have been specifically authorised by the
authorisation.
141 Subsection (3) sets out the matters which the designated senior officer must record within the
authorisation to obtain Part 3 data. These include:
a.
whether the Part 3 data may be obtained and disclosed by use of the filter;
b.
whether the processing of data under the filter is allowed;
c.
if the processing of data is allowed, then a description of data that may be processed
must also be included.
142 Subsections (4) and (5) reinforce the conditions that must be met before a designated senior
officer can authorise the use of a Request Filter. These conditions are: that it is necessary to
obtain the data for a public protection purpose; that it is necessary to obtain the data for a
specific investigation or a specific operation; and that the conduct authorised by the
authorisation is proportionate to what an investigator is seeking to achieve.
143 Subsections (2) to (5) will accordingly ensure that the use of any Request Filter under Part 3 is
specifically authorised by the authorisation, is proportionate and is recorded within the
authorisation.
Clause 53: Duties in connection with operation of filtering arrangements
144 Clause 53 imposes duties in connection with the operation of filtering arrangements. In the
case of a Request Filter, subsection (1) provides that no communications data must be obtained
or processed under the filter except for the purposes of an authorisation granted under clause
46. Data which has been obtained or processed under the filter, and is to be disclosed in
accordance with the authorisation or for the purposes of assisting the designated senior officer,
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
shall only be disclosed to authorised individuals. Further, subsection (1)(c) specifically requires
any data obtained by the filter to be immediately destroyed in such a way that it can never be
retrieved, once the purposes of the authorisation or of the assistance function have been met or
if at any time it ceases to be necessary to retain the data for these purposes.
145 Subsection (1) will ensure that only the filtered data relevant to the investigation is disclosed
to the requesting agency. Once the filter has provided the answer to the question, all the data
relating to the request will be deleted by the filter.
146 Subsection (2) limits the disclosure of data other than authorised data which is retained under
the filtering arrangements:
a.
to assist a designated senior officer to determine whether he believes the tests for
granting an authorisation are met;
b.
for the purposes of support, maintenance, oversight, operation or administration;
c.
to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner for the purposes of any his functions;
d. as otherwise authorised by law.
147 Subsection (3) requires strict limits to be placed on the persons who are permitted to read,
obtain or otherwise process data for the purposes of support, maintenance, oversight,
operation or administration in connection with the Request Filter. No other persons must be
permitted to access or use the capability except in pursuance of an authorisation or to assist the
designated senior officer to determine whether an authorisation is necessary and
proportionate.
148 Subsection (5) requires that an adequate security system is in place to protect against any abuse
of access to the Filter, as well as measures to protect against any unauthorised or unlawful data
retention, processing, access or disclosure. The duty in subsection (4) will ensure that a Request
Filter can only be used in accordance with Part 3 and is subject to adequate and effective
safeguards against abuse.
149 Subsection (6)(a) requires procedures to be put in place and maintained to ensure that the
Request Filter is functioning properly, including regular testing of the relevant software and
hardware. Subsection (6)(b) requires a report to be made, as soon as possible after the end of
each calendar year, to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner about the functioning of the
Request Filter during that year. Such a report must, in particular, contain information about
destruction of data during that year (subsection (6)). Subsections (5) and (6) will ensure that the
operation of any Request Filter is subject to rigorous oversight and control.
150 Subsection (8) requires any significant processing errors to be immediately reported to the
Investigatory Powers Commissioner. Subsection (7) constitutes a further safeguard with
respect to the operation of any Request Filter.
Clause 54: Relevant public authorities and designated senior officers
151 Clause 54 introduces Schedule 4 to the Bill and makes provision in relation to relevant public
authorities, designated senior officers and safeguards
152 Schedule 4 includes a table which lists the public authorities permitted to obtain
communications data under Part 3 of the Bill (column 1); the minimum office, rank or position
of the designated senior officers permitted to grant authorisations to obtain data (column 2);
the types of communications data that may be obtained (column 3); and the statutory purposes
for they may be obtained (column 4).
153 Subsection (2) provides that a public authority which is listed in column 1 of the table in
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Schedule 4 is a ‚relevant public authority‛ for the purposes of Part 3.
154 Subsection (3) establishes that, in this Part, a ‚designated senior officer‛ of a public authority
listed in column 1 of the table means an individual who either holds the office, rank or position
specified in column 2 of the table, or (subject to subsections (5) and (6)) an office, rank or
position which is higher than the level specified in the table.
155 Subsections (4) and (5) make clear that where column 2 of the table specifies a designated
senior officer by reference to a particular branch, agency, or other part of an authority, or
particular function of the authority, then only individuals who hold the specified office, rank,
or position in that part of the authority, or who have responsibility for those functions, may act
as the ‚designated senior officer‛.
156 Subsection (7) deals with cases where an individual is a designated senior officer by virtue of
more than one entry in the table. For example, a chief superintendent in a police force will be a
designated senior officer by virtue of being a higher rank than an inspector, and by virtue of
being a higher rank than a superintendent. Subsection (7) ensures that he can do both what an
inspector can do and what a superintendent can do.
Clause 55: Power to modify section 54 and Schedule 4
157 This clause provides that the Secretary of State may modify clause 54 and Schedule 4 by order.
Subsection (2) gives examples of what may be done under the general power in subsection (1).
These include adding or removing a public authority from the list in column 1 of a table in
Schedule 4. By virtue of clause 55 and clause 56, most orders under clause 54 will be subject to
the enhanced affirmative procedure. The exception is an order which modifies only column 2
of the table, which defines the designated senior officers of a public authority. By virtue of
clause 195 such orders will be subject to the negative resolution procedure.
158 Subsection (4) provides the Secretary of State with the power to make modifications by order in
any enactment which may be required as a result of a person becoming, or ceasing to be a
relevant public authority.
Clause 56: Certain regulations under section 55: supplementary
159 When making changes to the relevant public authorities in Schedule 4 by the affirmative
procedure, this clause requires the Government to consult the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner and the relevant public authority concerned. An example of this would include
adding a new public authority to the list of relevant authorities.
Clause 57: Local authorities as relevant public authorities
160 Clause 57 provides that local authorities are relevant public authorities for the purposes of Part
3, and defines the designated senior officers of local authorities.
Clause 58: Requirement to be party to collaboration agreement
161 This clause ensures that local authorities will only be able to obtain communications data if
they are party to a collaboration agreement as certified by the Secretary of State. This is a
safeguard that ensures local authorities are only able to acquire communications data through
an experienced shared single point of contact service.
Clause 59: Judicial approval for local authority authorisations
162 This clause provides a procedure by which local authority authorisations to obtain
communications data can only take effect if approved by a relevant judicial authority.
163 This means that a local authority authorisation granted under clause 57 will not take effect
until the "relevant judicial authority" has given its approval. The relevant judicial authority is
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
defined in subsection (7). In England and Wales, the judicial authority is a justice of the peace,
in Northern Ireland it is a district judge (magistrates’ court) and in Scotland, a sheriff.
Clause 60: Requirement to consult a single point of contact
164 The single point of contact (SPoC) is an accredited individual trained to facilitate lawful
acquisition of communications data and effective co-operation between a public authority and
CSPs. Clause 60 sets out how the SPoC and designated senior officer work together when
granting an authorisation for the acquisition of communications data.
165 Subsections (1), (2) and (3) set out that the designated senior officer must consult the SPoC
before granting an authorisation for communications data, unless there are exceptional
circumstances, such as an imminent threat to life or in the interests of national security.
166 Subsection (4) sets out what constitutes a SPoC, specifically that they must be an officer in a
relevant pubic authority with communications data powers and that they have a responsibility
for advising both those applying for the acquisition of communications data, and designated
senior officers that authorise such applications.
167 Subsections (5) and (6) set out the advisory role that a SPoC plays to both those applying for
communications data, and the designated senior officer that authorises the application.
SPoCs should advise whether the application and authorisation is lawful, appropriate and
cost-effective, and takes into consideration any unintended consequences.
168 Subsection (7) sets out that a SPoC may also provide advice to the designated senior officer
about whether the requirements of an authorisation have been met, its use in support of
operation or investigations and any other effects the authorisation may have.
Clause 61: Commissioner approval for authorisation to identify or confirm
journalistic sources
169 Clause 61 sets out the procedure for authorising communications data requests made by public
authorities, in order to identify a journalist’s source. In these instances it is necessary to obtain
the approval of a Judicial Commissioner before the data can be acquired.
170 Subsections (1), (2) and (3) set out that an authorised communications data application made
by certain public authorities for the purpose of identifying the source of journalistic
information must not take effect until approved by a Judicial Commissioner. Prior Judicial
Commissioner approval is not required in an imminent threat to life situation.
171 Subsection (4) sets out that in making an application for data to identify a journalistic source,
the applicant is not required to notify either the person to whom the applications relates i.e. the
journalistic source, nor that person’s legal representative.
172 Subsections (5) and (6) sets out that a Judicial Commissioner should only approve an
authorisation to acquire communications data to identify a journalistic source if satisfied that
the conditions of the authorisation by the designated senior officer have been met.
173 Subsection (6) sets out that the Judicial Commissioner must quash any authorisation given by
the designated senior officer, if the Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve it.
174 Subsection (7) sets out what is meant by the ‚source of journalistic information‛. It is defined as
an individual (i.e. the source) who provides material intending the recipient (i.e. the journalist)
to use it for the purpose of journalism or knowing that it is likely to be used for journalism.
Clause 62 and 63: Collaborations agreements
175 Clause 63 and 64 provide for collaboration agreements that allow designated senior officers
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
and SPoCs to be shared between public authorities. Such agreements can be voluntary or there
is a power for the Secretary of State to require them. Relevant public authorities may enter into
collaboration agreements in order to pool resources during busy periods. The power to require
collaboration agreements will be used to require public authorities that are less frequent users
of communications data to use the expertise of designated persons and SPoCs in other public
authorities who are more experienced in making applications.
Clause 64: Police collaboration agreements
176 The Police are already permitted to be in collaboration agreements and this outlines their
arrangements.
Clause 65: Lawfulness of conduct authorised by this Part
177 Subsection (1) has the effect of making conduct lawful for all purposes if it is conduct in which
that person is authorised to engage by virtue of an authorisation, and the conduct is in
accordance with, or in pursuance of, the authorisation.
178 Subsection (2) exempts a person from civil liability in respect of conduct which is incidental to,
or reasonably undertaken in conjunction with, that authorised in subsection (1). The conduct
must not itself be conduct for which an authorisation or warrant:
a.
is capable of being granted under the enactments referred to in subsection (3), and;
b.
might reasonably have been expected to have been sought in the case in question.
Clause 66: Offence of making unauthorised disclosure
179 Clause 66 creates a criminal offence, with a maximum prison sentence of two years, if a
communications services provider discloses any obligations under this Part of the Bill. It is a
reasonable excuse if such a requirement is disclosed with the permission of the public
authority who requested the data.
180 The intent of these provisions is to prevent the so called ‘tipping-off’ of criminal suspects or
subjects of interest that their data has been sought, thus informing them that they are under
suspicion.
181 Subsections (1) and (2) set out that employee from a communications service provider should
not disclose any information about a request from a relevant public authority for
communications data to a customer, without prior permission from the relevant public
authority.
182 Subsection (3) sets out that the punishment for being found guilty of such an offence.
183 Subsection (4) sets out the maximum prison term for committing such an offence in England
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Clause 67: Certain transfer and agency arrangements with public authorities
184 This clause allows for the Secretary of State by making regulations to transfer ownership of the
filtering arrangements to a public authority.
Clause 68: Applications of Part 3 to postal operators and postal services
185 Clause 68 provides that out that all clauses in Part 3 relating to communications service
providers also apply to postal operators.
Clause 69: Extra-territorial applications of Part 3
186 Clause 69 sets out that communications service providers overseas that handle
communications data of UK citizens are also covered by the provisions set out in Part 3 of the
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Bill.
Clause 70: Part 3: interpretation
187 Clause 70 clarifies terms that are regularly referred to throughout Part 3 of the Bill.
Part 4: Retention of Communications Data
Clause 71: Powers to require retention of certain data
188 This clause provides a power to require communications service providers to retain
communications data, where necessary and proportionate for one or more of the statutory
purposes (at clause 46(7)) for which it can be acquired for a maximum period of 12 months
189 Subsection (9) specifies the communications data that can be retained by what it can be used to
identify. For example, communications data can be retained if it may be used to identify, or
could assist in identifying, ‘the sender or recipient of a communication (whether or not a
person)’. Such communications data would include phone numbers, email addresses and
source IP addresses.
190 Subsection (9)(f) provides for the retention of internet connection records. Internet connection
records are a record of the internet services that a specific device connects to – such as a website
or instant messaging application – captured by the company providing access to the internet.
They could be used, for example, to demonstrate a certain device had accessed an online
communications service but they would not be able to be used to identify what the individual
did on that service. Clause 47 provides certain restrictions on the acquisition of internet
connection records. Clause 193 provides that in the particular context of web browsing
anything beyond data which identifies the telecommunication service (e.g. bbc.co.uk) is
content.
Clause 72: Matters to be taken into account before giving retention notices
191 Clause 72 sets out that before giving a retention notice to a communications service provider,
the Secretary of State must take into account a number of factors. These include: the likely
benefits of giving such a notice; the likely number of users of the CSP; the technical feasibility
of CSPs complying with the notice; and, any other impact that the notice may have on the CSP.
In addition the Secretary of State must take reasonable steps to consult a CSP before giving the
notice.
Clause 73: Review by the Secretary of State
192 This clause permits the recipient of a notice to refer the notice back to the Secretary of State
where the recipient of the notice considers an obligation unreasonable. Subsection (1) states
that the provider will have the opportunity to refer a notice either within a specified time
period or specified circumstances which will be set out in the regulations.
193 Subsection (4) states that the person is not required to comply with the specific obligations
under referral until the notice has been reviewed by the Secretary of State. The actions that the
Secretary of State must take in reviewing the notice and the role of the Technical Advisory
Board and the Investigatory Powers Commissioner are outlined at subsections (5-8).
194 Subsection (9) requires the Commissioner and the Technical Advisory Board to consult the
operator and report their conclusions to the operator and Secretary of State. After
consideration of the conclusions of the Commissioner and Board, the Secretary of State may
decide to confirm the effect of the notice, vary the notice or withdraw it.
195 Subsection (12) imposes an obligation on the Secretary of State to keep a notice under review,
regardless of whether or not it has been referred.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Clause 74: Data integrity and security
196 This clause requires data retained by virtue of this legislation must be kept securely and, once
the retention period expires, deleted in a way that ensures access is impossible.
Clause 75: Disclosure of retained data
197 Clause 75 sets out that communications service providers must put in place adequately
security procedures governing the access of communications data in order to protect it against
unlawful disclosure.
Clause 76: Variation or revocation of notices
198 Subsections (1)-(8) provide for the Secretary of State to vary a notice. Where a notice is varied
the same considerations will apply as in the giving of a notice.
199 Subsections (9)-(12) provide for the revocation of data retention notices in full or in part.
Clause 77: Enforcement of notices and certain other requirements and restrictions
200 This clause provides a power to the Secretary of State to enforce compliance of notices and
other matters by civil proceedings.
Clause 78: Application of Part 4 to public postal operators and public postal services
201 This clause specifies that the provisions of this Part also apply to postal services.
Clause 79: Extra-territorial application of Part 4
202 This provides that communications service providers based outside the United Kingdom, but
providing services to customers based within the United Kingdom, can retain relevant
communications data related to such customers. The communications service provider based
outside the United Kingdom has a duty to give regard to the requirement but they cannot be
compelled to comply with it.
Clause 80: Part 4: interpretation
203 This clause provides for interpretation of this Part, including references for relevant
definitions.
Part 5: Targeted Equipment Interference Warrants
Clause 81: Warrants under this Part: general
204 Clause 81 establishes a targeted equipment interference warrant, the activities and conduct it
may authorise together with the test of necessity and proportionality. Subsection (1) sets out
that a targeted equipment interference warrant authorises the interference with equipment for
the purpose of obtaining communications, private information or equipment data.
205 Subsection (3), (4) and (8) set out the activities that an equipment interference warrant may
authorise. An equipment interference warrant may authorise the recipient to obtain
(subsection (3)(a)), disclose (subsection (3)(b)), monitor (subsection (4) and examine
(subsection (9)) any communications, private information and equipment data. Subsection (5)
provides that any conduct necessary by any person, or a requirement on any person in the
warrant, can be carried out in order to give effect to an equipment interference warrant.
206 Subsection (6) of this clause ensures that an equipment interference warrant is not able to
permit activity that should be carried out under an interception warrant. If an investigation
requires both equipment interference and interception techniques then a combined warrant
may be issued.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Clause 82: Meaning of ‚equipment data‛
207 This clause defines the material which is equipment data in relation to a targeted equipment
interference warrant. Equipment data includes:
a.
Communications data (see clause 193);
b.
Data which enables or otherwise facilitates the functioning of any system or any
service provided by means of the system
c.
Data which is included in or associated with a communication or an item or private
information and either:
i. Does not form part of the content of the communication or the item of private
information, or
ii. If it does:
1.
Can be logically extracted from the content of any communication or
piece of private information;
2.
Which does not, once extracted, convey the meaning of any
communication or piece of private information; and
3.
Can identify, or assist in identifying, any person, apparatus, system or
service, or which describes an event, or the location of any person,
event or thing.
208 This definition provides a distinction between different types of data that may be obtained
from equipment interference, allowing appropriate restrictions to be applied to the selection
for examination of the more intrusive data. This ensures that if an equipment interference
operation gathers data of a UK person, their personal communications are subject to the same
strict authorisation process that applies to targeted equipment interference warrants. All
material obtained under targeted and bulk equipment interference warrants will be subject to
the stringent handling safeguards as out in Part 5 of the Bill.
209 Related communications data obtained under a bulk interception warrant is equivalent to
related communications data obtained under a targeted interception warrant, and equipment
data obtained pursuant to an equipment interference warrant.
210 In addition to communications data held on the device the data falling within this category
could include:
a.
The name of the person or account who stored a file on the device;
b.
the time and date of any files on the device were created or last modified;
c.
the operating system of the device and when it was last updated.
211 Subsection (8) provides a definition of the content of any communication or item of private
information based around the meaning of the communication or item of private information
excluding any meaning that can be inferred from the fact of the communication or existence of
the item of information.
Clause 83: Subject-matter of warrants
212 This clause sets out the scope of equipment interference warrants. For interference to be
considered targeted it must relate to a particular person or persons (so for example, the
computer equipment of Person X); organisation or organisations (so, for example, the
computer equipment of Organisation X); a particular location where the equipment being
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
interfered with is present (so for example, computer equipment located at House X); or
equipment that is being used for testing and development. The targeted equipment
interference warrant may also relate to equipment where there is a common link between
multiple people, locations or organisations where the interference is for the purpose of the
same investigation or operation (so, for example, computers believed to being used by
Terrorist Plot Group X), or equipment that is being used for a particular activity . These latter
warrants have sometimes been described as ‘thematic’.
Clause 84: Power to issue warrants to intelligence services: the Secretary of State
213 Clause 84 establishes the process and requirements for equipment interference warrants that
are applied for and issued to a director of one of the intelligence services. The intelligence
services comprise the Security Service (MI5), the Secret Intelligence Service and Government
Communication Headquarters (GCHQ).
214 Subsection (1) sets out that equipment interference warrants issued to the intelligence services
must be necessary for one of three statutory purposes, set out in full in subsection (4). Either
the warrant must be in the interest of national security, for the purposes of preventing or
detecting serious crime, or in the interests of the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom so
far as those interests are also relevant to the interests of national security.
215 Subsection (1) also sets out that it is permitted for a warrant to be applied for on behalf of the
head of one of the services, meaning it is not necessary for every warrant application to be
made personally by the head of service. Subsection (7) states that when a warrant is applied for
on behalf of a head of service the application must be made by a person holding office under
the Crown.
216 Subsection (2) prevents the Secretary of State issuing a warrant that relates to serious crime in
Scotland. This is because Scotland have devolved responsibility for matters relating to crime.
Clause 86 addresses the process for such warrants.
217 Subsections (3) and (6) together ensure that the a warrant may only be issued if the Secretary of
State believes that the activity set out in the warrant is proportionate to the intended outcome
and that there is not a reasonable alternative method to achieving the same outcome.
Clause 85: Additional protection for Members of Parliament etc.
218 This clause requires the Secretary of State to consult the Prime Minister before deciding to issue
a targeted equipment interference or examination warrant where the purpose may be to obtain
the communications of a person who is a member of a relevant legislature. Subsection (3)
defines "member of a relevant legislature‛.
Clause 86: Power to issue warrants to intelligence services: the Scottish Ministers
219 Clause 86 explains that when a targeted EI warrant – for the purpose of preventing and
detecting serious crime - relates to interference with equipment believed to be in Scotland, it is
the responsibility of Scottish Ministers, rather than the Secretary of State, to issue the warrant.
This only applies to the intelligence services, as law enforcement agencies will apply to their
chief constable, or equivalent. The same consideration of necessity and proportionality still
applies as set out in (1) (b) and (c) and the same independent judicial approval process will
follow, should the warrant be issued.
Clause 87: Power to issue warrants to the Chief of Defence Intelligence
220 Clause 87 makes provision for the Chief of Defence Intelligence to apply for equipment
interference warrants. The same restrictions as outlined in clause 84(1) apply but in respect to
the Chief of Defence Intelligence, with approval also dependent upon the Secretary of State’s
acceptance. The exception in this instance is that warrants issued to the Chief of Defence
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Intelligence are reserved for national security purposes.
Clause 88: Decision to issue warrants under sections 84 to 87 be taken personally by
Ministers
221 Clause 88 states that the Secretary of State or Scottish Minister must be the decision maker and
signatory of any warrant issued under this power to the intelligence services and defence
intelligence. This ensures that they are accountable for the use of this power and have the
opportunity in all cases to ensure that its use is necessary and proportionate.
222 There are some instances in which the Secretary of State or Scottish Minister will not be able to
physically sign a warrant in sufficient time to allow crucial operations to take place. In these
circumstances a designated senior official will sign the warrant, as per subsections (3) and (4)
(b). The Secretary of State or Scottish Minister is still the decision maker in these instances and
will confirm verbally with the designated official that he or she is in agreement that the
warrant is to be signed.
Example:
A person has been kidnapped and a ransom is being demanded with the
threat that the individual will be shot imminently. In such urgent threat
to life cases, especially outside of normal working hours, it may not be
possible or practical for the Secretary of State to physically sign a warrant.
Clause 89: Power to issue warrants to law enforcement officers
223 Clause 89 establishes the process and requirements for equipment interference warrants that
are applied for by law enforcement officers and issued by a law enforcement chief.
224 Subsection (1) sets out the conditions that must be met for a law enforcement chief to issue a
targeted equipment interference warrant. Subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) establish the tests of
necessity and proportionality, with subsection (1)(a) providing that the purpose of a warrant
being necessary to prevent and detect serious crime. In other words, a law enforcement chief
may only issue a targeted information warrant if he believes that the warrant is necessary to
prevent and detect serious crime and that the conduct authorised is proportionate. Subsection
(1) (d) provides that all decisions to issue a warrant require the approval of a Judicial
Commissioner, except where the law enforcement chief believes there is an urgent case to issue
the warrant. The process for urgent warrants is covered at clause 91. Subsection (1)(c) provides
that in order to issue a warrant a law enforcement chief must be satisfied that satisfactory
arrangements are in place to safeguard the material obtained (as detailed in clause 101).
225 Subsection (2) provides that a law enforcement chief may delegate the power to issue a
targeted equipment interference warrant to an appropriate delegate. The power to issue
warrants should usually only be delegated in urgent cases, and only when it is not reasonably
practical for a law enforcement chief to consider the application and issue the warrant. The
appropriate delegates in each law enforcement agency that can apply for an equipment
interference warrant is detailed in the table at subsection (3) including details of other statutory
delegation arrangements (such as for the Director General of the National Crime Agency).
226 Subsection (3) sets out the different roles and responsibilities that fall within the categories of
law enforcement chief, appropriate delegate, and law enforcement officer for all the law
enforcement agencies that may apply for an equipment interference warrant.
227 Subsection (4) sets out the additional arrangements for the applications and issuing of
equipment interference warrants where a police force is a collaborative force under section 22A
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
of the Police Act 1996.
228 Subsection (5) sets out the definition of a police force in Part 5.
229 Subsection (6) provides that the reference to the purpose of preventing and detecting serious
crime in subsection (1)(a), in the case of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, should also be
read as a reference to the interests of national security.
Clause 90: Approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners
230 This clause explains the role of a Judicial Commissioner in targeted equipment interference
warrants. Subsection (1) reiterates the same test of necessity and proportionality that the
Secretary of State, Scottish Minister or law enforcement chief will have applied when issuing
the warrant. The Judicial Commissioner, as per subsection 89 (2), will apply the same
principles as they would apply in a judicial review and determine whether the person issuing
the warrant has properly considered the necessity and proportionality of the operation or
investigation.
231 Following their considerations a Judicial Commissioner can approve the warrant, refuse to
approve the warrant or refer the warrant to the Investigatory Powers Commissionerfor further
consideration.
232 Subsections (4) and (5) set out that should a warrant be refused by a Judicial Commissioner
they must give written reasons for the refusal to the applicant. Should the person requesting
the warrant so wish they may then refer the application to the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner for their opinion.
Clause 91: Approval of warrants issued in urgent cases
233 Clause 91 establishes the process for the approval of equipment interference warrants in urgent
cases. These are warrants that will be issued in cases that demand very quick actions from the
applicant that cannot wait until a Judicial Commissioner has approved the warrant. For
example, in a serious crime context an urgent warrant may be required if a law enforcement
agency understands that a person’s life is in immediate danger and equipment interference
would obtain the communications etc, that may be used to prevent imminent harm. These
warrants will still be issued by the Secretary of State or law enforcement chief. In the case of the
intelligence agencies and Defence Intelligence there may be urgent circumstances where the
warrant may be signed by a designated official on behalf of the Secretary of State. In those
circumstances it will still be incumbent on the Secretary of State to make the decision to issue
the warrant before authorising the designated official to sign the warrant.
234 Subsections (2) to (6) set out the role of the Judicial Commissioner once a warrant has been
issued through the urgent process. It is the duty of the person who issues an urgent warrant to
inform the Judicial Commissioner that they have done so. This will prompt the Judicial
Commissioner to either approve the warrant, allowing it to continue to have effect; or refuse to
approve the warrant, in which case the activity described within the warrant should cease. This
process must not exceed 5 working days.
235 If the Judicial Commissioner neither approves nor refuses to approve an urgent warrant it will
cease to have effect five working days from the date that it was issued – this is described in
subsection (3).
Clause 92: Warrants ceasing to have effect under section 91
236 This clause details the process that follows when a warrant is refused by a Judicial
Commissioner, having previously been issued under urgent provisions.
237 The Judicial Commissioner has responsibility for determining what should be done with the
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
data obtained up to this point. In all instances this will be the same Judicial Commissioner (or
the Investigatory Powers Commissioner) that refused the warrant.
238 Subsection (3) explains that a Judicial Commissioner has the power to authorise additional
equipment interference after refusing to approve a warrant, where such interference will
enable any ongoing or future interference to cease as soon as possible.
239 Subsection (8) clarifies that if a warrant is refused, or not approved, the actions carried out
whilst the warrant was active are not made invalid or unlawful by the ceasing of the warrant.
This ensures that the recipient and their delegated officials can act appropriately and with
confidence as soon as the urgent warrant is issued.
Clause 93: Requirements that must be met by warrants
240 Clause 93 directs the warrant applicant to include a description of what activity the warrant
will be intended to facilitate. The applicant will also explain why the warrant is needed,
provide an understanding of who the warranted activity will effect and describe the techniques
that will be used to effect the warrant. This is the information that the Secretary of State or law
enforcement chief and Judicial Commissioner will use whilst considering whether the activity
is necessary and proportionate when compared to the expected outcome.
Clause 94: Duration of warrants
241 Subsection (2) sets the standard duration of a warrant at 6 months. It also states when that 6
months begins, both for the initial warrant and any subsequent renewals. An exception applies
for urgent warrants, which are described in subsection (3) and last for five working days.
Clause 95: Renewal of warrants
242 Subsections (1), (2) and (3) state that at any time before the warrant expires a renewal can be
issued by the Secretary of State, Scottish Minister or law enforcement chief where relevant. In
either case a Judicial Commissioner will also need to approve the renewal of the warrant. The
person renewing the warrant will at this stage need to confirm that the activity described in the
warrant remains necessary and proportionate.
243 Subsections (5) (6) and (7) ensures that any renewals are done personally by the Secretary of
State, law enforcement officer or Scottish Minister where relevant. This provides the
opportunity to review the necessity and proportionality of the action. The warrant will not be
renewed if the action is no longer necessary or proportionate.
244 In the context of urgent warrants, renewals serve the purpose of allowing the Secretary of
State, law enforcement chief or Scottish Minister and a Judicial Commissioner to review the
warrant and, should they consider it necessary and proportionate, extend the duration to 6
months.
Clause 96: Modifications of warrants
245 This clause addresses the possibility that warrants may need to be modified. For instance this
may be when different action is required to progress the investigation because, for example,
the target of the investigation has a new smart phone) or when new subjects of interest become
relevant to the investigation.
246 Subsection (2) sets out the different elements of a warrant that are subject to modification.
These elements have the potential to change as an operation or investigation develops.
247 Modifications can also include the removal of subjects from a warrant. This may occur if an
operation determines that one or more of the subjects are not of intelligence interest, but other
subjects also on the warrant remain of interest. In this instance the Secretary of State or Scottish
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Minister, or a designated senior official, can remove the unnecessary subjects from the warrant,
minimising any incursions in to their privacy. In the case of warrants issued by law
enforcement chiefs such modifications will be made by the relevant law enforcement chief or a
designated official, with approval from a Judicial Commissioner, as explained in subsection
(3).
248 Subsection (6) makes clear that all modifications to equipment interference must be approved
by a Judicial Commissioner. This ensures that once a warrant has been approved by a Judicial
Commissioner any changes that may alter the effects of the warrant are also visible and can, if
necessary, be refused.
Clause 97: Modification of warrants: supplementary provision
249 This clause sets out that only the warrant granter, or a designated official, are able to enact
modifications to targeted equipment interference warrants. In cases when a modification is
enacted by a senior official they have a duty under subsections (2) and (3) to inform the
Secretary of State/Scottish Minister.
Clause 98: Cancellation of warrants
250 This clause sets out that a Secretary of State, Scottish Minister, law enforcement chief or
designated senior official in a warrant granting department has the power to cancel a warrant
at any time, if the warrant was originally issued by their organisation.
251 Subsection (2) makes it a requirement that once a warrant is no longer necessary, or if through
a change of circumstance the conduct is no longer proportionate, the appropriate person must
cancel that warrant. This provision will ensure that equipment interference is not able to
continue for any longer than is strictly necessary, minimising any potential incursions of
privacy.
Clause 99: Implementation of warrants
252 Subsection (1) gives the recipient of the warrant the power to work with others to carry out the
actions outlined in the warrant. Subsection (2) specifies that the warrant recipient can serve a
copy of the warrant to a person if they think that the person is able to help them carry out the
warranted actions.
Clause 100: Service of warrants
253 This clause sets out how a targeted equipment interference warrant may be served upon a
person outside the United Kingdom when the warrant recipient requires their assistance.
Subsection (2) sets out the three possible options for serving a warrant in this situation.
Subsection (3) states that the third option set out in subsection (2) – to make the warrant
available for inspection in the United Kingdom – should not be used unless the options under
subsection (2) (a) and (b) are not reasonably practicable.
Clause 101: Duty of telecommunications providers to assist with implementation
254 Clause 101 places a duty upon telecommunications providers to assist with the
implementation of targeted equipment interference if they are served with a copy of a warrant
by the warrant recipient.
255 Subsections (1) (2) and (3) set out that this duty is limited to a selection of organisations that
mirrors the agencies permitted to use interception techniques. In all cases the Secretary of State
or Scottish Minister will approve the proposed interference, even if the normal warrantry
process would not require their involvement (for instance, for warrants issued to law
enforcement officers).
256 Subsection (7) provides that the duty to comply with a warrant is enforceable by civil
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
proceedings brought by the Secretary of State.
Clause 102: Offence of making unauthorised disclosure
257 Clause 102 details the requirement for telecommunications providers to not disclose the
existence of any equipment interference warrant that they may be required to assist with to the
subject of that warrant.
258 Subsection (2) gives the warrant recipient the power to allow the telecommunications provider
to disclose the existence and nature of the warrant should they need to.
Clause 103: Safeguards for material obtained
259 Clause 103 places a duty on the warrant requestor to ensure safeguards are in place for any
data acquired by the activity permitted through that warrant. This is intended to protect the
privacy of anyone affected by a warrant and maintain the integrity of the operations to which a
warrant relates.
260 Subsection (6) defines appropriate authority, which means that the Secretary of State or
Scottish Ministers must be satisfied that adequate arrangements are in place for warrants
issued under clauses 84-87. For warrants issued under clause 89, it is for the person to whom
the warrant is addressed (the law enforcement officer) to ensure arrangements are in place.
Clause 104: Restriction on issue of targeted equipment interference warrants to certain
law enforcement officers
261 Clause 104 established the jurisdiction of equipment interference warrants for law enforcement
officers, with restrictions applying to UK police forces. The limitations rest on the activity
having a connection to the British Islands
262 Subsection (1) provides that UK police forces may only apply for an equipment interference
warrant where there is a connection to the British Islands. A UK police force is a police force
maintained under section 2 of the Police Act 1996, the Metropolitan Police force, the City of
London Police, the Police Service of Scotland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
263 Subsection (2) described a connection to the British Islands as:
a.
the proposed activity would take place in the British Islands (regardless of where the
equipment to be interfered with is located); or
b.
the UK police force believes the equipment to be interfered with may be located in the
British Islands at some point during the interference itself. The computer would be
located in the British Islands or carried by someone transiting through the British
Islands at the time the interference is taking place; or
c.
the purpose of the interference is to enable the acquisition of the private information or
the communications sent to or from a person believed to be in the British Islands. The
interference is aimed at a person in the British Islands.
264 Subsection (3) provides that all other law enforcement officers are able to apply for an
equipment interference warrant under section 85 [j905] in circumstances where there is a
connection to the British Islands and also where there is no connection to the British Islands.
Subsection (3) applies to the National Crime Agency, HM Revenue and Customs, Ministry of
Defence Police, Royal Military Police and the Royal Air Force Police.
Clause 105: Part 5: Interpretation
265 Clause 105 provides definitions for ‘communications’, ‘equipment’, ‘private information’ and
‘senior official’ that ensure that all intended applications of equipment interference are
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
captured under the powers set out in this Bill.
Part 6: Bulk Warrants
Chapter 1: Bulk interception warrants
Clause 106: Bulk interception warrants
266 This clause describes a bulk interception warrant and sets out the two conditions that a
warrant issued under this chapter must meet.
267 Subsection (2) limits the main purpose for which a warrant may be sought to obtaining
overseas-related communications or the obtaining of related communications data from such
communications. This prevents the issue of a bulk interception warrant with the primary
purpose of obtaining communications between people in the British Islands.
268 Subsection (3) defines ‚overseas-related communications‛ as communications that are sent or
received by persons outside of the British Islands.
269 Subsection (4) sets out the conduct that may be authorised under a bulk interception warrant in
order to intercept overseas-related communications or related communications data.
270 Subsection (5) sets out the conduct that a bulk interception warrant authorises, other than the
conduct described in the warrant itself. This might include the interception of communications
between persons in the British Islands if that interception is unavoidable in order to achieve the
main purpose of the warrant.
Example:
A bulk warrant is sought for the interception of communications. The
primary objective of the warrant is to obtain the communications of
persons believed to be outside the UK, which are likely to be of national
security interest and may be selected for examination subsequently. Due
to the nature of internet-based communications, it is inevitable that some
communications between persons in the UK will also be intercepted. In
order to examine those communications, a targeted examination warrant
must be sought. This will need to be issued by the Secretary of State and
approved by a judge.
271 Subsections (6)-(9) define what related communications data is in relation to a bulk
interception warrant. In contrast to the position for targeted warrants, the data may (but need
not) be obtained by, or in connection with, interception. Related communications data
includes:
a.
Communications data (see clause 193);
b.
Data obtained through a warrant which enables or otherwise facilitates the functioning
of any telecommunications system or any telecommunications service provided by
means of the system;
c.
Data which:
i. Can be logically extracted from the content of the communication;
ii. Which does not, once extracted, reveal the meaning of the content of the
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
communication; and
iii. Can identify, or assist in identifying, any person, apparatus,
telecommunication system or telecommunications service, or which describes
an event, or the location of any person, event or thing.
272 Related communications data as defined in this clause may only be obtained under a bulk
interception warrant and, once the data is obtained, will be subject to the safeguards set out in
Chapter 1 of Part 6.
273 Related communications data obtained under a bulk interception warrant is equivalent to
related communications data obtained under a targeted interception warrant, and equipment
data obtained pursuant to an equipment interference warrant.
274 This clause makes clear that the extraction of any data from the content of a communication
that has been acquired during the course of its transmission can only take place under an
interception warrant.
275 In addition to communications data the data falling within this category could include:
a.
The version of the app sending the message;
b.
Data relating to any files attached to a message such as the date and time it was created
and the author;
c.
Any location information related to the communication, for example the location
required to enable an application;
d. Any email addresses contained within a communication.
Clause 107: Power to issue bulk interception warrants
276 This clause sets out the power to issue bulk interception warrants. Subsections (1) to (7) set out
the power for the Secretary of State to issue a bulk interception warrant, only where it is
necessary and proportionate, which must also be approved by a Judicial Commissioner, on
behalf of an intelligence agency for one or more specified statutory purposes. The interests of
national security must always be one of those purposes.
277 Subsection (1) also requires the Secretary of State to believe it is necessary to examine material
obtained under the warrant for specified Operational Purposes. This will provide a detailed
list of purposes for which examination of intercepted material may be necessary. Before
selecting any material for examination, a member of an intelligence service will need to be sure
that the examination is necessary for one of those purposes.
278 Subsection (5) requires the Secretary of State, when considering whether the warrant is
necessary and proportionate, to take into account whether the information it is thought
necessary to obtain under the warrant could reasonably be obtained by other means.
Clause 108: Additional requirements in respect of warrants affecting overseas
operators
279 This clause outlines the requirements relating to warrants that the Secretary of State believes
are likely to require the assistance of a telecommunications operator who is based outside the
United Kingdom to give effect to the warrant.
280 Subsection (2) requires that the Secretary of State must consult the relevant
telecommunications operator before issuing the warrant.
281 Subsection (3) sets out factors that must be taken into account before issuing the warrant in
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
those cases. These include costs and technical feasibility, as well as the likely benefits of the
warrant.
Clause 109: Approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners
282 Subsection (1) sets out the matters that must be reviewed by a Judicial Commissioner when
deciding whether to approve a bulk interception warrant, including a consideration of
necessity and proportionality and the necessity of the operational purposes.
283 Subsection (2) requires that, in determining the matters in subsection (1), a Judicial
Commissioner must apply judicial review principles.
Clause 110: Decisions to issue warrants to be taken personally by Secretary of State
284 This clause requires the Secretary of State personally to take the decision to issue a bulk
interception warrant and that the warrant must be signed by the Secretary of State before it can
be issued.
Clause 111: Requirements that must be met by warrants
285 This clause sets out the information which must be contained in a bulk interception warrant.
Subsection (3) requires that a warrant must set out the Operational Purposes for which any
intercepted material, or related communications data, obtained under the warrant can be
examined.
Clause 112: Duration of warrants
286 This clause sets out the details surrounding the duration of a bulk interception warrant. Bulk
interception warrants will last for six months, beginning on the day the warrant was issued.
Clause 113: Renewal of warrants
287 This clause sets out the conditions for renewing a bulk interception warrant. The decision to
renew a bulk interception warrant must be taken personally by the Secretary of State.
288 Subsection (2) sets out the conditions that must be met for a warrant to be renewed. These
include that the Secretary of State believes that the warrant continues to be necessary and
proportionate in relation to relevant statutory purpose(s) and that the decision to renew the
warrant has also been approved by a Judicial Commissioner.
Clause 114: Modification of warrants
289 This clause sets out the conditions for modifying a bulk interception warrant.
290 Subsection (2) specifies that the only modifications that may be made under this section are
adding, varying or removing any Operational Purpose specified in the warrant.
291 Subsection (4) requires that any modification to add or vary an Operational Purpose must be
made by a Secretary of State and approved by a Judicial Commissioner.
292 Subsection (6) provides for a senior official, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, to make a
modification where an Operational Purpose is being removed. Subsection (8) requires that,
where this is the case, the Secretary of State must be personally notified of the modification, as
well as the reasons for making it.
Clause 115: Cancellation of warrants
293 This clause sets out the circumstances under which a bulk interception warrant may be
cancelled.
294 Subsection (2) requires that where a Secretary of State or senior official decides the warrant is
no longer necessary, or the conduct authorised by it is no longer proportionate, they must
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
cancel the warrant.
Clause 116: Implementation of warrants
295 This clause sets out the requirements for giving effect to a bulk interception warrant. This
replicates the provisions relating to the implementation of a targeted interception warrant.
Clause 117: General safeguards
296 This clause sets out the general safeguards which apply to bulk interception warrants. This
replicates the general safeguards which apply to the handling of targeted interception
warrants.
Clause 118: Safeguards relating to disclosure of material or data overseas
297 This clause sets out the safeguards relating to the disclosure of intercept material overseas in
relation to a bulk interception warrant. This replicates the safeguards for overseas disclosure in
relation to targeted interception warrants.
Clause 119: Safeguards relating to examination of material or data
298 This clause sets out the safeguards relating to the examination of intercepted material and
related communications data which has been acquired under a bulk interception warrant.
Subsection (1) requires that intercepted material and related communications data may only be
examined for specified purposes and must be necessary and proportionate. Subsection (2)
explains that examination is for specified purposes if material or data is only examined in so far
as is necessary for the Operational Purposes specified in the warrant.
299 Subsection (4) places a prohibition on selecting intercepted material for examination if any
criteria used for the selection of that material refer to an individual known to be currently in
the British Islands and are aimed at identifying the content of communications sent by or
intended for that individual. Where such examination is required, a targeted examination
warrant must be obtained, issued by the Secretary of State and approved by the Judicial
Commissioner.
Example:
A member of an intelligence service is investigating an international
terrorist group and one of that group regularly travels to the UK. In order
to enable the selection of that person’s communications for examination,
including during the periods when he is in the UK, a targeted
examination warrant must be sought. This will need to be issued by the
Secretary of State and approved by a judge.
300 Subsection (5) deals with cases in which there is a change of circumstances such that a person
whose communications were being selected for examination is discovered to be in the British
Islands or has entered the British Islands. In those cases, a senior official may authorise the
continued selection for examination for a period of five days. Any selection after that point will
require the issue of a targeted examination warrant.
Example:
A member of an intelligence service is investigating an international
terrorist group and suddenly one of that group is discovered to have
arrived in the UK. In order to continue investigating that member of the
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
group a senior official must authorise further selection. This
authorisation only lasts for five days, after which the selection for
examination of his communications must cease or a targeted examination
warrant must be sought. This will need to be issued by the Secretary of
State and approved by a judge before any further selection is permitted.
Clause 120: Application of other restrictions in relation to warrants
301 This clause sets out that the exclusion of matters from legal proceedings apply to bulk
interception warrants. The duty not to make unauthorised disclosure also applies to bulk
interception warrants.
Clause 121: Chapter 1: interpretation
302 This clause defines various terms relating to bulk interception warrants which are used in this
chapter.
Chapter 2: Bulk acquisition warrants
Clause 122: Power to issue bulk acquisition warrants
303 Subsection (1) sets out the power for the Secretary of State to issue a bulk acquisition warrant,
only where it is necessary and proportionate, which must be approved by a Judicial
Commissioner, on behalf of an intelligence agency for one or more specified statutory
purposes. The interests of national security must always be one of those purposes.
304 Subsection (1) also requires the Secretary of State to believe it is necessary to examine material
obtained under the warrant for specified operational purposes. This will provide a detailed list
of purposes for which examination of bulk communications data may be necessary. Before
selecting any material for examination, a member of an intelligence service will need to be sure
that the examination is necessary for one of those purposes.
305 Subsection (4) requires the Secretary of State, when considering whether the warrant is
necessary and proportionate, to take into account whether the information it is thought
necessary to obtain under the warrant could reasonably be obtained by other means.
306 Subsection (5) describes a bulk acquisition warrant. Subsection (6) sets out that the warrant
authorises requiring a telecommunications operator to disclose specified communications data
in its possession or obtain and disclose communications data which is not in its possession; the
selection for examination of the data obtained under the warrant and the onward disclosure of
such data.
307 Subsection (7) provides for a bulk acquisition warrant to authorise conduct necessary to do
what is required by the warrant.
308 Subsection (8) provides that a bulk acquisition warrant may be issued on a forward looking
basis.
Clause 123: Approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners
309 Subsection (1) sets out the matters that must be reviewed by a Judicial Commissioner when
deciding whether to approve a bulk acquisition warrant, including a consideration of necessity
and proportionality and the necessity of the operational purposes.
310 Subsection (2) requires that, in determining the matters in subsection (1), a Judicial
Commissioner must apply judicial review principles.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
311 Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a warrant they must set out written reasons
for their refusal. This will allow the agency requesting the warrant to alter their application and
what action they are seeking to take in order to meet any concerns expressed by the Judicial
Commissioner.
312 Should a Judicial Commissioner, other than the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, refuse to
approve a decision to issue a warrant the Secretary of State may escalate the case to the
Investigatory Powers Commissioner and ask them to approve the decision to issue the
warrant. Should the Investigatory Powers Commissioner refuse to approve the warrant then
there is no further right of appeal from that decision.
Clause 124: Decisions to issue warrants to be taken personally by Secretary of State
313 This clause requires that the decision to issue a bulk acquisition warrant must be taken by the
Secretary of State and that the Secretary of State must sign the warrant before it is issued.
Clause 125: Requirements that must be met by warrants
314 This clause requires an application for the issue of a bulk acquisition warrant to be made by or
on behalf of the head of an intelligence agency and that the warrant must be addressed to the
intelligence agency which made the application.
315 Subsection (3) requires a warrant to identify the operational purposes for which data can be
examined and selected for examination. Subsection (4) sets out the scope of operational
purposes.
Clause 126: Duration of warrants
316 This clause sets out that a bulk acquisition warrant has a duration of 6 months from the date of
issue or, in the case of a renewed warrant from the day after it would otherwise have expired.
Clause 127: Renewal of warrants
317 This clause sets out the conditions for renewing a bulk interception warrant. The decision to
renew a bulk acquisition warrant must be taken personally by the Secretary of State.
318 Subsection (2) sets out the conditions that must be met for a warrant to be renewed. These
include that the Secretary of State believes that the warrant continues to be necessary and
proportionate in relation to relevant statutory purpose(s) and that the decision to renew the
warrant has also been approved by a Judicial Commissioner.
Clause 128: Modification of warrants
319 This clause sets out the conditions for modifying a bulk acquisition warrant.
320 Subsection (2) specifies that the only modifications that may be made under this section are
adding, varying or removing any operational purpose specified in the warrant.
321 Subsection (4) requires that any modification to add or vary an operational purpose must be
made by a Secretary of State and approved by a Judicial Commissioner.
322 Subsection (6) provides for a senior official, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, to make a
modification where an operational purpose is being removed. Subsection (8) requires that,
where this is the case, the Secretary of State must be personally notified of the modification, as
well as the reasons for making it.
Clause 129: Cancellation of warrants
323 This clause sets out the circumstances under which a bulk acquisition warrant may be
cancelled.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
324 Subsection (2) requires that where a Secretary of State or senior official decides the warrant is
no longer necessary, or the conduct authorised by it is no longer proportionate, they must
cancel the warrant.
Clause 130: Implementation of warrants
325 This clause sets out how a bulk acquisition warrant is implemented, including assistance with
giving effect to the warrant and how the warrant may be served, with reference to the
applicable provision relating to the implementation of a targeted interception warrant.
Subsection (6) provides that the duty to comply with a warrant is enforceable by civil
proceedings brought by the Secretary of State.
Clause 131: General safeguards
326 This clause sets out the safeguards which apply to bulk acquisition warrants. Subsection (2)
and (3) require the Secretary of State concerned ensure arrangements are in place to limit the
disclosure of data to that which is required for an authorised purpose and that data is only held
securely and destroyed when there are no longer grounds for retaining it. Subsection (6)
provides protection for data disclosed to authorities of a country or territory outside the UK.
Clause 132: Safeguards relating to examination of data
327 This clause provides that data obtained under a warrant may only be examined in accordance
with the warrant.
Clause 133: Offence of making unauthorised disclosure
328 This clause makes it an offence for persons specified in subsection (1) to make an unauthorised
disclosure to another person in relation to a bulk acquisition warrant. Subsection (2) lists the
circumstances where disclosure is authorised. Subsection (3) sets out the maximum penalties
for the offence.
Clause 134: Chapter 2: interpretation
329 This clause defines the terms used in this Chapter.
Chapter 3: Bulk Equipment Interference Warrants
Clause 135: Bulk equipment interference warrants
330 Clause 135 sets out the characteristics of bulk equipment interference. Unlike the equipment
interference described in Part 5 bulk equipment interference is not targeted against particular
person(s), organisation(s) or location(s) or against equipment that is being used for particular
activities.
Clause 136: Meaning of ‚equipment data‛
331 This clause defines the material which is equipment data in relation to a bulk equipment
interference warrant. Equipment data includes:
a.
Communications data (see clause 193);
b.
Data which enables or otherwise facilitates the functioning of any system or any
service provided by means of the system;
c.
Data which is included in or associated with a communication or an item or private
information and either:
i. Does not form part of the content of the communication or the item of private
information, or
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
ii. If it does:
1.
Can be logically extracted from the content of any communication or
piece of private information;
2.
Which does not, once extracted, convey the meaning of any
communication or piece of private information; and
3.
Can identify, or assist in identifying, any person, apparatus, system or
service, or which describes an event, or the location of any person,
event or thing.
332 This definition provides a distinction between different types of data that may be obtained
from equipment interference, allowing appropriate restrictions to be applied to the selection
for examination of the more intrusive data. This ensures that if an equipment interference
operation gathers data of a UK person, their personal communications are subject to the same
strict authorisation process that applies to targeted equipment interference warrants. All
material obtained under targeted and bulk equipment interference warrants will be subject to
the stringent handling safeguards as out in Chapter 3 of Part 6 of the Bill.
333 Related communications data obtained under a bulk interception warrant is equivalent to
related communications data obtained under a targeted interception warrant, and equipment
data obtained pursuant to an equipment interference warrant.
334 In addition to communications data held on the device the data falling within this category
could include:
a.
The name of the person or account who stored a file on the device;
b.
The time and date of any files on the device were created or last modified;
c.
The operating system of the device and when it was last updated.
335 Subsection (8) provides a definition of the content of any communication or item of private
information based around the meaning of the communication or item of private information
excluding any meaning that can be inferred from the fact of the communication or existence of
the item of information.
Clause 137: Power to issue bulk warrants
336 This clause sets out the power to for the Secretary of State to issue a bulk equipment
interference warrant, only where it is necessary and proportionate, which must be approved
by a Judicial Commissioner, on behalf of an intelligence agency for one or more specified
statutory purposes. The interests of national security must always be one of those purposes. It
also requires the Secretary of State to believe it is necessary to examine material obtained under
the warrant for specified Operational Purposes. Only three authorities may apply for a bulk
equipment interference warrant - the Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service and
GCHQ.
Clause 138: Approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners
337 Subsection (1) sets out the matters that must be determined by a Judicial Commissioner when
deciding whether to approve a bulk equipment interference warrant, including a consideration
of necessity and proportionality.
338 Subsection (2) requires that, in determining the matters in subsection (1), a Judicial
Commissioner must apply judicial review principles.
339 Subsections (3) and (4) set out that a Judicial Commissioner can either approve a warrant,
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
refuse to approve a warrant or refer the application to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner
for further consideration.
Clause 139: Decisions to issue warrants to be taken personally by Secretary of State
340 This clause ensures that the decision to issue a bulk equipment interference warrant may only
be taken by a Secretary of State. Subsection (2) sets out that the warrant must also be
subsequently signed by the Secretary of State.
Clause 140: Requirements that must be met by warrants
341 This clause sets out the information which must be contained in a bulk equipment interference
warrant.
342 Subsection (3) requires the person requesting a warrant to set out specifically what the
purpose/s are for which the selection for examination of the material from the interference is
necessary. The person requesting the warrant might for example state that the proposed
interference will be used to gather intelligence relating to terrorism in a particular country.
Clause 141: Duration of warrants
343 This clause sets out the details surrounding the duration of a bulk equipment interference
warrants. Upon approval, bulk equipment interference warrants will last for a maximum of six
months.
Clause 142: Renewal of warrants
344 This clause sets out the conditions for renewing a bulk equipment interference warrant. The
decision to renew a bulk equipment interference warrant must be taken personally by the
Secretary of State. The six month period between renewals ensures that the Secretary of State
will periodically review whether a warrant is still necessary should the agency wish to renew.
An independent Judicial Commissioner will also review any warrants submitted for renewal.
Clause 143: Modification of warrants
345 This clause sets out the conditions for modifying a bulk equipment interference warrant. Any
modifications to the stated purposes of the interference will be enacted by the Secretary of State
with approval of a Judicial Commissioner, maintaining the authorisation level that applied to
the original warrant application. If the requested modification is to remove a stated purpose
the Secretary of State may delegate a senior official for this task, as set out in subsection (6). If a
senior official makes a modification they must inform the Secretary of State of this change.
Clause 144: Cancellation of warrants
346 This clause sets out the circumstances under which a bulk equipment interference warrant may
be cancelled.
347 Subsection (2) ensures that if an appropriate person is satisfied that the warrant is no longer
required, they must cancel it. This may include a designated senior official in the warrant
granting department, or in the warrant requesting agency.
Clause 145: Implementation of warrants
348 This clause sets out the requirements for giving effect to a bulk equipment interference
warrant. This replicates the provisions relating to the implementation of a targeted equipment
interference warrant and ensures that a person to whom the warrant is addressed may work
with others to effect the activity described within it.
349 Subsection (4) states that the same provision for targeted equipment interference that allows a
warrant holder to compel a telecommunications provider to assist in the implementation of
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
warranted activity applies in the same way for bulk equipment interference.
Clause 146: General safeguards
350 This clause sets out the general safeguards which apply to bulk equipment interference
warrants. This replicates the general safeguards which apply to the handling of targeted
equipment interference warrants.
351 The clause ensures that any disclosure of the information obtained through bulk equipment
interference is kept to a minimal amount. Any copies of the information are also kept to a
minimum. However subsection (4) states that the disclosure of material obtained through these
methods is permitted in the interest of legal proceedings. This ensures that the product of bulk
equipment interference activities can be used as evidence, should it be required.
352 Subsection (7) sets out that should the information obtained be shared with authorities outside
of the United Kingdom, that equivalent measures are in place.
Clause 147: Safeguards relating to examination of material etc
353 This clause sets out the safeguards relating to the examination of material which has been
acquired under a bulk equipment interference warrant.
354 Subsection (4) introduces the safeguards that apply to ‘protected content’. This is any content
of persons within the British Islands, mirroring the safeguards provided in the bulk
interception regime. So, where a UK person's communications are being targeted for
examination, a targeted EI warrant will be required.
355 This distinction ensures that any examination of UK persons data obtained through these
techniques is authorised by the Secretary of State and an independent Judicial Commissioner
on the grounds of necessity and proportionality.
Example:
A member of an intelligence service is targeting a hostile foreign
intelligence officer through a bulk EI operation. The foreign intelligence
officer is overseas, so the analyst can examine the content that they
acquire through the provisions made in the bulk EI warrant. That foreign
intelligence officer decides to visit the UK. At this point, a targeted EI
examination warrant must be sought in order to examine any content
acquired through bulk EI relating to the target.
Clause 148: Application of other restrictions in relation to warrants under this
Chapter
356 This clause is self-explanatory.
Clause 149: Chapter 3: interpretation
357 This clause defines various terms relating to bulk equipment interference warrants which are
used in this chapter.
Part 7: Bulk Personal Datasets
Clause 150: Bulk personal dataset: interpretation
358 Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances in which, for the purposes of this Bill, an intelligence
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
service obtains a bulk personal dataset (BPD). An intelligence service is defined in the general
definitions clause of the Bill to mean the Security Service (MI5), Secret Intelligence Service
(MI6) or GCHQ. As a result, the safeguards set out in later clauses must be followed if these
circumstances are met.
359 Subsection (2) sets out the circumstances in which it is considered that an intelligence service
retains a BPD. As a result, the safeguards set out in later clauses must be followed if these
circumstances are met.
360 Subsection (3) defines personal data. The definition is the same one as in the Data Protection
Act 1998 (DPA) except that it also encompasses data relating to deceased persons. This slight
widening of the DPA definition is because the bulk personal datasets that an intelligence
agency may obtain or acquire might include data relating to deceased persons.
Example:
The electoral roll, which would be a bulk personal dataset if it was
obtained by an intelligence service and retained in one of its analytical
systems, will inevitably include persons who are deceased given it is not
updated constantly.
Clause 151: Requirement for authorisation by warrant: general
361 This clause specifies that an intelligence service may not exercise a power to obtain, retain or
examine a BPD without a warrant. Subsection (4) describes the two types of warrant provided
for under this Part of the Bill – a ‘class’ or a ‘specific’ warrant.
Clause 152: Exceptions to Section 151(1) to (3)
362 This clause explains when the general requirements listed in the previous clause do not apply.
Subsection (1) states that a BPD warrant is not required as long as the acquisition, retention and
examination of the BPD is governed by another regime outlined in this Bill - for example an
interception warrant under which a BPD as well as intercept material is acquired.
363 Subsection (2) clarifies that a warrant is not needed when a BPD is being retained for the
purpose of enabling an application for a specific BPD warrant relating to that dataset. This
allows intelligence agencies who have received unsolicited BPD or a BPD that falls outside an
existing class BPD warrant to retain the dataset while going through the process of obtaining
the necessary specific BPD warrant.
364 Subsection (3) clarifies that BPD can be retained or examined to enable the information
contained in it to be deleted. If a warrant is cancelled or a specific warrant is not approved, it
will not always be possible for the intelligence agency to delete it immediately from their
systems. This provision allows the agencies to hold the BPD while they are ensuring that the
relevant data is entirely removed from their systems and ensure that they are legally
compliant.
Clause 153: Class BPD warrants
365 This clause explains how the class BPD warrant authorisation process works.
366 Subsection (2) specifies what an application to get a class warrant must include – a description
of the class of BPD and an explanation of the purposes for which the intelligence agency wishes
to examine the dataset.
367 Subsection (3) explains that a Secretary of State can issue a class warrant (thus enabling the
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
obtaining, retention and examination of BPDs of that class) if s/he believes that the warrant is
necessary (for the standard reasons of national security etc.) and proportionate, and that
satisfactory handling measures (for example, protective security measures) are in place. The
Secretary of State must also consider that the examination of the BPDs is necessary for the
operational purposes specified in the warrant. In addition, a Judicial Commissioner must have
approved the decision to issue a warrant. (A subsequent clause includes further provision
relating to approval of warrants by the Judicial Commissioner, including that in deciding this
matter the Judicial Commissioner applies judicial review principles.) This is the same process
as for the interception and equipment interference powers in the Bill – before a warrant can
come into force the Secretary of State must issue it and then a Judicial Commissioner must
review the Secretary of State’s decision and approve it and only then may the warrant come
into force.
368 Subsection (4) requires a class BPD warrant to include a description of the class of BPD to
which the warrant relates and the operational purposes for which the dataset may be
examined.
369 Subsections (5) and (6) explains that BPD cannot be examined for an operational purpose not
specified in the warrant and that an application can only be made on behalf of the head of an
intelligence service by a person holding office under the Crown.
Clause 154: Specific BPD warrants
370 As well as class warrants, in certain circumstances the Bill states that an intelligence service
may seek a specific warrant (i.e. one for a specific dataset rather than a ‘class’ of them). The
cases in which it would be appropriate to seek a specific warrant are set out in subsections (2)
and (3).
371 Subsection (2) describes the first scenario for this type of warrant being used. This is where
the dataset does not fall within a class described by an existing BPD warrant. An example of
this could be when a new or novel type of dataset is obtained.
372 Subsection (3) describes the second scenario for this type of warrant being used. This is when
a dataset falls within a class warrant, but, for any reason, the intelligence service believes that it
would be appropriate to seek a specific warrant. An example of this could be when an
intelligence agency receives a dataset that, while already covered by a class warrant, could
raise international relations concerns such that the intelligence agency believes that the
Secretary of State should decide whether to authorise the obtaining and use of that specific
dataset.
373 The terms of what the application must include is set out in subsection (4) – a description of the
specific dataset and an explanation of the operational purposes for which the dataset is to be
examined.
374 Subsection (5) describes the circumstances in which a specific BPD warrant can be issued by
the Secretary of State. They are the same ones as for a class BPD warrant: the Secretary of State
can issue a specific warrant if s/he believes that it is necessary for specified purposes and
proportionate, and that adequate handling arrangements (for example through appropriate
protective security measures) are in place. And the Secretary of State must also consider that
the examination of the BPDs is necessary for the operational purposes specified in the warrant.
In addition, a Judicial Commissioner must have approved the decision to issue a warrant. (A
subsequent clause includes further provision relating to approval of warrants by the Judicial
Commissioner, including that in deciding this matter the Judicial Commissioner applies
judicial review principles.)
375 Subsection (6) makes provision to ensure a warrant can authorise the use of a particular BPD
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
and replacements to that BPD – for example if the BPD was updated on a regular basis.
376 Subsection (7) indicates that a specific BPD warrant must also contain a description of the
particular BPD to which the warrant relates; a description allowing the identification of
replacement datasets (see subsection (6)); and the operational purposes for which the dataset
may be examined.
377 Subsections (8) and (9) explains that the specific BPD cannot be examined for an operational
purpose not specified in the warrant and that an application can only be made on behalf of the
head of an intelligence service by a person holding office under the Crown.
Clause 155: Approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners
378 This clause explains the process by which the Judicial Commissioner will consider whether to
approve the Secretary of State’s decision to issue the warrant. It is consistent with role of
Judicial Commissioners in authorisation in the rest of the Bill (e.g. in authorising interception
warrants).
Clause 156: Approval of warrants issued in urgent cases
379 This clause applies for specific BPD warrants only, where, if the Secretary of State believed that
there was an urgent need to issue it, a specific BPD warrant may be made without the approval
of the Judicial Commissioner. It states that if this happens, the Commissioner must be
informed that an urgent warrant has been issued and, within five working days, decide
whether to approve the issue of that warrant and notify the Secretary of State of their decision.
This is the same approach as for urgent targeted interception warrants. Subsection (4) explains
that this is not required if the Judicial Commissioner is notified within that time that the
warrant will be renewed through the normal renewal process outlined in a later clause.
Subsection (5) explains that if the Commissioner refuses to approve the decision to issue the
warrant, it ceases to have effect.
Clause 157: Warrants ceasing to have effect under section 156
380 This clause explains the process if a specific warrant that was issued under the urgency
procedure above ceases to have effect. Subsection (2) states that anything being done under
that warrant should stop as soon as possible. Subsection (3) explains that if a Judicial
Commissioner refused to approve the warrant, he/she may determine what to do with the
material that was obtained under that warrant. They may direct that the material is destroyed
or impose conditions as to the retention or examination of any of the material. Subsections (4)
and (5) explain that the Commissioner can require representations from either the intelligence
service or the Secretary of State, and must have regard to any representations received by these
parties, before deciding what to do with the material. Subsections (6) and (7) explain that an
appeal can be made to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner. Subsection (8) ensures that
actions taken in reliance on a warrant before it ceases to have effect or at the point it ceases to
have effect (and which cannot reasonably be stopped) remain lawful.
Clause 158: Decisions to issue warrants to be taken personally by Secretary of State
381 This section specifies that the decision to issue a class or specific BPD warrant must be taken
personally by the Secretary of State. A warrant must also be signed by the Secretary of State,
unless it is an urgent case as outlined in an earlier clause, when a senior official can sign the
warrant, with a statement included that the Secretary of State has personally expressly
authorised the issue of the warrant.
Clause 159: Requirements that must be met by warrants
382 This clause explains that a BPD warrant application must state that it is a ‘class’ or ‘specific’
BPD warrant and must be addressed to the intelligence service concerned.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Clause 160: Duration of warrants
383 This clause explains that, for non-urgent warrants, the warrant comes into effect at the point
at which it is issued or, in the case of a renewed warrant, the day following the day on which it
would otherwise have ceased to have effect. In either case, it lasts for six months. An urgent
warrant lasts for five working days after the day on which it was issued. These durations are
consistent with other forms of warrants in the Bill.
Clause 161: Renewal of warrants
384 Subsections (1) to (3) set out that a Secretary of State may renew a ‘class’ or ‘specific’ BPD
warrant if s/he continues to believe it is necessary and proportionate, and if s/he considers that
the examination of the BPDs continues to be necessary for the operational purposes specified
in the warrant, and provided that the Secretary of State’s renewal decision is approved by a
Judicial Commissioner. This is consistent with other forms of warrant in the Bill.
Clause 162: Modification of warrants
385 This clause explains the process by which BPD warrants can be modified, what constitutes a
major or minor modification to a BPD warrant and who would be authorised to make or
approve those modifications.
Clause 163: Cancellation of warrants
386 This clause sets out that a Secretary of State or senior official designated by the Secretary of
State can cancel a BPD warrant at any time.
Clause 164: Non-Renewal or cancellation of class BPD warrants
387 This clause sets out the process if a class BPD warrant is not renewed or is cancelled and in
particular what to do with the material that was obtained under that class BPD warrant.
Subsection (2) specifies that the intelligence service may apply to the Secretary of State for
directions as to what should be done with this material. Subsection (3) specifies that the
Secretary of State can direct that any of the material should be destroyed or, with the approval
of the Judicial Commissioner, can authorise the retention or examination of any of the material.
This may be the case if, for example, the Secretary of State no longer believes that an entire
class of BPD should be retained, but that it is necessary and proportionate to retain a subset or
subsets of that material. If the Judicial Commissioner does not approve a decision to authorise
the continued retention or examination of any of the material, he or she must give the Secretary
of State written reasons for this (subsection (4)). Subsection (5) provides that if a Judicial
Commissioner other than the Investigatory Powers Commissioner does not approve such a
decision, the Secretary of State can ask the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to decide
whether to approve the decision.
Clause 165: Duty to have regards to code of practice
388 This clause requires the intelligence services to have regard to any Code of Practice issued
under this Bill that is applicable to BPDs. The Government intends to issue such a Code of
Practice.
Clause 166: Interpretation of Part
389 This clause defines specific terms used in this Part.
Part 8: Oversight Arrangement
Chapter 1: Judicial Commissioners
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Clause 167: Investigatory Powers Commissioner and other Judicial Commissioners
[j760]
390 This clause establishes the office of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, who will be
supported in fulfilling their functions by other Judicial Commissioners. No-one will be
appointed as the Investigatory Powers Commissioner or as a Judicial Commissioner unless
they have held a judicial position at least as senior as a high court judge. To allow them to work
effectively, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner will be able to delegate functions to the
other Judicial Commissioners. The Investigatory Powers Commissioner is a Judicial
Commissioner, so where the Bill or these Explanatory Notes refers to a Judicial Commissioner
this includes the Investigatory Powers Commissioner.
Clause 168: Terms and conditions of employment
391 The Judicial Commissioners will be appointed for fixed terms of three years and can be
re-appointed. Subsections (2)-(5) ensure the independence of the Judicial Commissioners by
limiting the circumstances in which they can be removed from office. The Investigatory Powers
Commissioner can only be removed from office with the say so of both Houses of Parliament,
unless some very limited circumstances apply, including the Commissioner being given a
prison sentence or disqualified from being a company director. Other Judicial Commissioners
can be removed from office in the same way, but they can also be removed from office by the
Investigatory Powers Commissioner (subsection (6)).
Clause 169: Main oversight functions
392 This clause gives the Investigatory Powers Commissioner a very broad remit to keep under
review the use of investigatory powers. The Investigatory Powers Commissioner must do so
through audits, inspections and investigations. In particular the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner will undertake, with the assistance of their office, the functions currently
undertaken by the Intelligence Services Commissioner, the Interception of Communications
Commissioner and the Surveillance Commissioner.
393 However, subsection (4) explains that, to prevent inefficiency and duplication of oversight, the
Investigatory Powers Commissioner will not oversee particular areas that are already subject
to oversight by other individuals or bodies. The Investigatory Powers Commissioner will not
oversee decisions by other judicial authorities or where information is obtained through a
search warrant or production order issued by a judicial authority. The Investigatory Powers
Commissioner will not oversee matters which are overseen by the Information Commissioner.
394 Subsection (5) and (6) seek to ensure that the oversight activities do not have a negative effect
upon the ability of law enforcement agencies and security and intelligence agencies to perform
their statutory functions. These subsections do not apply to the judicial functions of the
Commissioners – such as deciding whether to approve the issuing, renewing or modification
of a warrant.
Clause 170: Additional directed oversight functions
395 As the policies, capabilities and practices of the security and intelligence agencies change with
time, subsections (1)-(3) allow the Prime Minister to direct the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner to oversee new areas. This is important to ensure that independent oversight
keeps pace with developments within the security and intelligence agencies.
396 Subsection (5) sets out that the Prime Minister must publish any direction that he makes to the
Investigatory Powers Commissioner to ensure that there is full transparency about their role.
However, this will need to be balanced against a situation where saying too much about what
is being overseen will give away details of the policy or capability to the extent that it damages
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
national security.
Clause 171: Error reporting
397 This clause provides for a process through which people can be informed of serious errors in
the use of investigatory powers. An error means any error made by a public authority in
complying with any requirement which the Investigatory Powers Commissioner has oversight
of.
398 When the Investigatory Powers Commissioner becomes aware of an error, the Commissioner
must decide whether the error is serious. An error can only be considered serious if it has
caused significant prejudice to the person concerned. If the Commissioner thinks that the error
is serious the IPT must be informed. If the IPT agrees that the error is serious, the IPT must then
decide whether it is in the public interest for the person concerned to be informed. In doing so
the IPT must balance on one hand the seriousness of the error and the impact on the person
concerned, and on the other hand the extent to which disclosing the error would be contrary to
the public interest or would be prejudicial to national security, the prevention and detection of
serious crime, the economic well-being of the UK, or the ability of the intelligence agencies to
carry out their functions.
399 If the IPT decides that the person should be informed, that person must also be informed of
their right to bring a claim in the IPT. The person must also be provided with the details
necessary to bring such a claim, to the extent that disclosing information is in the public
interest.
400 The Investigatory Commissioner’s annual report (see clause 172(1)) must include details
regarding errors, including the number of errors the Commissioner becomes aware of, the
number referred to the IPT and the number of times a person has been informed of an error.
Clause 172: Additional functions under this Part
401 This clause sets out that a Judicial Commissioners must give the IPT any assistance the IPT
may ask for, including Commissioner’s opinion on anything the IPT has to decide. This allows
the IPT to take advantage of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's expertise and the
expertise of his office when reaching a decision or carrying out an investigation.
402 Subsection (2) allows the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to provide advice and
information to both public authorities and the general public. If the Commissioner thinks that
providing such information or advice might be contrary to the public interest or be damaging
to one of the things listed, including national security, the Commissioner must consult with the
Secretary of State first.
Clause 173: Functions under other enactments
403 This clause means that authorisations that are currently approved by the Surveillance
Commissioner will instead be approved by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner.
Clause 174: Annual and other reports
404 Subsection (1) means that the Investigatory Powers Commissioner must report to the Prime
Minister on an annual basis about their work and subsection (2) lists matters which must be
included in the report. The Prime Minister may require additional reports. The Investigatory
Powers Commissioner may report at any time on any matter the Commissioner has oversight
of. The Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s reports can include any recommendations the
Commissioner thinks are appropriate.
405 Subsections (3) & (4) state that upon receipt of an annual report from the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner the Prime Minister must publish that report and lay it before Parliament.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
However, the Prime Minister may redact information from the report if that information
would damage national security or damage operational effectiveness. The Prime Minister must
consult with the Investigatory Powers Commissioner before deciding to redact anything from
the report.
406 Reports that are laid before Parliament must be sent to the Scottish Ministers and the First
Minister and deputy First Minister to be laid before the Scottish Parliament and the Northern
Irish Assembly.
Clause 175: Information and inspection powers
407 This clause ensures that the Investigatory Powers Commissioner has access to the information
necessary to carry out the Commissioner’s oversight role effectively. The clause does this by
requiring people to provide the Investigatory Powers Commissioner with all the information
and documents that the Commissioner may need. They must also provide the Commissioner
with any assistance the Commissioner may need when carrying out an inspection. The persons
to whom these obligations apply includes public authorities and also telecommunications and
postal operators who are subject to obligations under this Act.
Clause 176: Funding, staff and facilities
408 Subsection (1) explains that the Judicial Commissioners will be paid a salary and may be paid
expenses. The amount will be decided by the Treasury.
409 Subsection (2) requires the Secretary of State to provide the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner with the staff, accommodation, equipment and facilities that the Secretary of
State thinks necessary. It is intended that the resources afforded to the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner will ensure that the office is fully staffed with judicial, official, legal and
technical support to ensure that the Commissioners are fully able to perform their oversight
and authorisation functions and to hold those that use investigatory powers to account. In
determining the resources that should be provided the Secretary of State will consult with the
Investigatory Powers Commissioner. Treasury approval will be required as to the number of
staff. Should the Investigatory Powers Commissioner believe that the resources afforded to
them are insufficient then they may publicly report the fact in their Annual Report.
Clause 177: Power to modify functions
410 This clause allows the functions of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to be changed. This
would require the approval of both Houses of Parliament. The ability to change the function
allows a level of flexibility about the role of the Commissioner to ensure that it can be modified
and adapted to fit with the work that needs to be overseen.
Clause 178: Abolition of existing oversight bodies
411 This clause confirms that the Investigatory Powers Commissioner will replace the existing
commissioners who provide oversight of investigatory powers: the Interception of
Communications Commissioner, the Surveillance Commissioner (including Assistant
Surveillance Commissioners), the Intelligence Services Commisisoner and the Investigatory
Powers Commissioner for Northern Ireland. The abolition of the Surveillance Commissioner
and Assistant Surveillance Commissioner includes those appointed by Scottish Ministers for
the purposes of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000.
Chapter 2: Other arrangements
Clause 179: Codes of practice
412 This clause provides for the Secretary of State to issue Codes of Practice covering the use of
powers covered by the Bill, as outlined in Schedule 6.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Clause 180: Right of appeal from the Tribunal
413 Currently there is no domestic route of appeal from decisions of the Investigatory Powers
Tribunal, with Claimant’s having to issue appeals to the European Court of Human Rights if
they wish to challenge a decision. This clause introduces a domestic appeal route from
decisions of the IPT on a point of law, to the Court of Appeal (for England and Wales) or its
equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland (to be detailed in Regulations).
414 Where there is a point of law, the decision on whether to grant permission to appeal will be
taken by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal in the first instance. If the Tribunal refuses to grant
permission to appeal then this decision may be reviewed by the appeal court.
415 The Tribunal must only give permission to appeal on a point of law where the appeal would
raise an important point of principle or practice or they consider that there are other
compelling reasons to grant permission to appeal.
Clause 181: Functions of Tribunal in relation to Part 4
416 This clause extends the functions of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal in relation to retention
notices under Part 4.
Clause 182: Oversight by Information Commissioner in relation to Part 4
417 The Information Commissioner must audit requirements related to the retention of
communications data, for example, to ensure the data is retained securely. This is distinct from
the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s requirements in respect of the acquisition of
communications data.
Clause 183: Technical Advisory Board
418 This Clause provides for the continued existence by order of a Technical Advisory Board. Its
make-up will be prescribed by Secretary of State regulations and must include a balanced
representation of the interests of communications service providers and of those people listed
in subsection (2b).
Part 9: Miscellaneous
Clause 184: Combination of warrants and authorisations
419 This clause explains that Schedule 7 (which is explained further below) allows for the
combination of targeted interception and equipment interference warrants with other warrants
or authorisations. This builds on the existing ability to combine certain warrants and
authorisations (RIPA allows authorisations that combine Property interference (under the
Intelligence Services Act 1994) and Intrusive Surveillance).
Clause 185: Payments towards certain compliance costs
420 This clause requires the Secretary of State to ensure that there are arrangements to secure that
communications service providers receive a fair contribution towards their costs of complying
with the provisions in the Act. Subsection (6) makes clear that the appropriate contribution
must never be nil. Subsection (7) requires that a retention notice under Part 4 or national
security notice under clause 188 must specify the level of contribution to be made.
Clause 186: Power to develop compliance systems etc
421 This clause enables the Secretary of State to develop, provide, maintain or improve equipment
that can be used by the Secretary of State, another public authority or any other person to
facilitate compliance with the provisions in the Act. The clauses also enables the Secretary of
State to enter into financial arrangements with any other person to develop, provide, maintain
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
or improve any such system.
Clause 187: Amendments of the Intelligence Services Act 1994
422 Subsection (1) describes the act to be amended - the Intelligence Services Act 1994.
423 Subsection (2)(a) adds in to subsection (1)(a) of the existing clause 3 of ISA, that GCHQ can
‚make use of‛ as well as ‚monitor or interfere with electromagnetic, acoustic and other
emissions and any equipment producing such emissions and to obtain and provide
information derived from or related to such emissions or equipment and from encrypted
material‛. This clarifies that GCHQ may, in the performance of its functions, make use of
communications services in the manner in which it was intended they would be used. This
could be used for public communications as well as for investigative purposes.
424 Subsection (2)(b) amends ISA to allow GCHQ to provide advice and assistance on the
protection of information to other organisations and members of the public as appropriate.
This will enable GCHQ to provide information assurance advice to a wide audience on issues
which impact not just HMG but also business and the public in general e.g. cyber security.
425 Subsection (3) amends ISA to remove the restriction on GCHQ and SIS to take action in
support of the prevention and detection of serious crime in the UK, as well as overseas.
Currently ISA only permits such activity where it is in support of MI5. The security and
intelligence agencies have a remit to support law enforcement to help prevent and detect
serious crime.
Clause 188: National security notices
426 This clause provides for the Secretary of State to issue a national security notice to any
telecommunications operator requiring the operator to take steps as appear to the Secretary of
State to be necessary in the interests of national security.
427 Subsection (2) specifies that a national security notice may only be given by the Secretary of
State where it is necessary and proportionate to do so.
428 Subsection (3) outlines the types of support that the telecommunications operator may be
required to provide to satisfy the requirement, for example to provide services or facilities
which would assist the intelligence agencies in safeguarding the security of their personnel and
operations.
429 Subsection (4) stipulates that the notice cannot be used where the primary purpose is to
authorise interference with privacy. In any circumstance where a notice would involve the
acquisition of communications or data a warrant or authorisation from the relevant part of this
Act would always be required in parallel.
Clause 189: Maintenance of technical capability
430 This clause allows for the making of regulations by the Secretary of State to impose obligations
upon telecommunications operators, which would be required to effect warrants or acquisition
notices on a recurrent basis
431 Subsection (1) provides the mechanism by which the Secretary of State may impose obligations
upon persons providing or planning to provide public postal services or public
telecommunications services. The Secretary of State will do this through regulations which
specify the obligations on those service providers listed in subsection (2). These regulations
will enable the Secretary of State to impose obligations on particular providers by the service of
individual notices describing in much greater detail the precise steps they are required to take.
432 Subsection (3) sets out the cases in which regulations may specify an obligation in relation to
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
warrants issued under Part 2, 5 or 6, or authorisations or notices given under Part 3. The
Secretary of State may specify an obligation only where the Secretary of State believes the
obligations are reasonable, and with the aim of ensuring that providers are capable of
providing the technical assistance
433 Subsection (4) sets out the types of obligations that may be imposed for example in (a)
providing communications facilities and capacity to support the implementation of warrants
or (d) ensuring the security of facilities or staff who may be required to handle classified
material.
434 Subsection (5) requires the Secretary of State to consult with a number of people prior to
making the regulations. These include the Technical Advisory Board, the persons likely to have
obligations imposed on them and their representatives, and persons with statutory functions
affecting providers of communication services.
435 Subsection (6) explains that the technical capability notice will set out specific steps that the
providers will be required to provide in order to comply with the obligations and subsection
(7) makes clear that the steps must be necessary to ensure the subject of the notice has the
practical capability to provide assistance as required.
436 Subsection (8) confirms that a technical capability notice can be given to persons outside the
United Kingdom. These may relate to conduct outside of the United Kingdom.
Clause 190: Further provision about notices under section 188 or 189
437 This clause provides further details about notices under the previous two sections. Subsection
(3) sets out the considerations the Secretary of State must take into account prior to serving
either a national security notice or technical capability notice. Consideration of the time
required to comply with the notice is covered in subsection (4).
438 Subsection (5) set out the mechanisms by which a notice may be given to a person outside the
United Kingdom.
439 Subsection (9) requires persons served with a notice under sections 178 or 179 to comply with
it.
440 Subsections (10-11) outlines that the Secretary of State may bring civil proceedings to enforce
both a national security and technical capability notice on persons within the UK. For persons
outside of the UK, the Secretary of State may only bring civil proceedings to enforce a technical
capability notice which relates to only interception warrants or an authorisation or notice given
under Part 3.
Clause 191: Review by the Secretary of State
441 This clause permits the recipient of a notice to refer the notice back to the Secretary of State
where the recipient of the notice considers an obligation unreasonable. Subsection (1) states
that the provider will have the opportunity to refer a notice either within a specified time
period or specified circumstances which will be set out in the regulations.
442 Subsection (4) states that the person is not required to comply with the specific obligations
under referral until the notice has been reviewed by the Secretary of State. The actions that the
Secretary of State must take in reviewing the notice and the role of the Technical Advisory
Board and the Investigatory Powers Commissioner are outlined at subsections (5-8).
443 Subsection (9) requires the Commissioner and the Technical Advisory Board to consult the
person and the Secretary of State, and report their conclusions to the person and Secretary of
State. After consideration of the conclusions of the Commissioner and Board, the Secretary of
State may decide to confirm the effect of the notice, vary the notice or withdraw it.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Clause 192: Amendments of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006
444 This clause makes clear that the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 no longer provides authority for
the use of wireless telegraphy to intercept information as to the contents, sender or addressee
of a message. Instead, this Bill provides for such interception.
Chapter 2: General
Clause 193: Telecommunications definitions
445 This clause provides relevant definitions in relation to telecommunication systems, services
and operators. These new categories are intended to be technology neutral and replace the
three categories of communications data in RIPA: traffic data, service-use data and subscriber
data which no longer adequately reflect the data available from telecommunication operators
or systems.
446 Subsection (2) defines a telecommunication. It includes communications between persons,
between a person and a machine and between machines.
447 Subsection (3) defines entity data as data about entities or links between them but does not
include information about individual events. Entities could be individuals, groups and objects.
448 Subsection (4) defines events data as data which identifies or describes events taking place on a
telecommunication system or other device which consist of one or more entity engaging in an
activity at a specific point, or points, in time and space.
449 Subsection (5) defines the subset of entity data and events data which constitute
communications data. The authorisation levels provided for in Schedule 4 reflect the fact that
the set of events data as a whole contains the more intrusive communications data.
Example 1: Entity Data:
Phone numbers or other identifiers linked to communications devices;
address provided to a communications service provider; IP address
allocated to an individual by an internet access provider.
Example 2: Events Data:
The fact that someone has sent or received an email, phone call, text or
social media message; the location of a person when they made a mobile
phone call or the Wi-Fi hotspot that their phone connected to; the
destination IP address that an individual has connected to online.
450 Subsection (6) provides a definition of content based around the meaning of the
communication excluding any meaning that can be inferred from the fact of the
communication. While it is possible to draw an inference from the fact a person has contacted
another person this is distinct from the content of the call.
451 Subsection (6)(a) provides that in the particular context of web browsing anything beyond data
which identifies the telecommunication service (e.g. bbc.co.uk) is content. Accordingly
bbc.co.uk, google.co.uk or facebook.com would be communications data but data showing
what searches have been made on Google or whose profiles have been viewed on Facebook
would be content.
452 Subsections (8-14) define communication service providers and systems for the purpose of the
bill.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
Clause 194: Postal definitions
453 This provision defines the scope of communications data in the postal context. Subsection
(3)(a), (b) and (c) are traffic data, service use data and subscriber data respectively. These
definitions will continue to remain relevant in a postal context.
Clause 195: General definitions
454 This provision is self-explanatory.
Clause 196: Offences by bodies corporate
455 This provision applies if a body corporate or Scottish partnership, or a senior officer within a
body corporate or Scottish partnership commits an offence under this Act.
Clause 197: Regulations
456 This clause outlines the procedure under which the Secretary of State may make regulations.
It sets out that regulations made under certain specified sections of the Bill must be laid before
Parliament and approved by a resolution of both Houses.
Clause 198: Enhanced affirmative procedure
457 This clause outlines the ‘enhanced affirmative procedure’. This is a procedure for making
secondary legislation that allows for further scrutiny than the affirmative procedure, outlined
in the proceeding clause. It applies to clause 55, which deals with modifying Schedule 4. In
particular this means that there will be an enhanced scrutiny process should the Government
wish to provide for additional authorities to be able to acquire communications data. The
enhanced scrutiny process includes a statutory duty to consult and for a relevant
parliamentary committee to comment on the draft legislation. The Secretary of State must have
regard to these representations.
Clause 199: Financial provisions
458 This provision is self-explanatory.
Clause 200: Transitional, transitory or saving provision
459 This clause states that Schedule 7 applies and gives power for the Secretary of State to make
any transitional, transitory or saving provisions as he or she considers appropriate in
connection with the coming into force of the provisions in the Bill. This standard power enables
the changes made the Bill to be implemented in an orderly manner.
Clause 201: Minor and consequential provision
460 This clause states that Schedule 6 applies and that the Secretary of State may make any
provision by regulation as is considered necessary as a consequence of the provisions of the
Bill.
Clause 202: Commencement, extent and short title
461 This clause is self-explanatory.
Schedules
Schedule 1: Monetary Penalty Notices
Part 1: Monetary Penalty Notices
462 Schedule 1 provides for the of paying of monetary fines to the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner for the penalty of carrying out interception without authority, without a
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
warrant or carrying out interception which is not in accordance with a warrant, as specified in
clause 6. This provision was originally inserted into the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act
2000 in 2011 (SI 2011/1340). This followed a letter in April 2009 in which the European
Commission set out that the UK had not properly transposed Article 5 (1) of the E-Privacy
Directive and Articles 2(h), 24 and 28 of the Data Protection Directive.
463 Paragraph 1 requires any fine imposed by the Commissioner to be paid within the period
specified in the penalty notice which begins the day after the penalty notice is imposed and
cannot be less than 28 days. Any fine must be paid into the Consolidated Fund.
464 Paragraph 2 subsections (a) to (h) set out the information which a monetary penalty notice
issued by the Commissioner must contain.
465 Paragraph 3 provides for an enforcement obligation to be included in the monetary penalty
notice if the Commissioner believes the interception is continuing. Subsection (2) sets out that
the enforcement obligation requires the person on whom the notice is served to either cease
interception on a specified day, or to either - take such steps or refrain from taking specified
steps as appropriate, within a specified period, which results in the cessation of the
interception. Subsection (3) specifies that an enforcement obligation may not be acted upon for
a period of 7 days which begins on the day after the monetary penalty notice is served.
466 Paragraphs 4-6 set out the requirement to consult before a monetary penalty notice may be
served. Paragraph 4 specifies that before serving a monetary penalty notice on a person, the
Commissioner must serve a notice of intent alerting a person to the fact that the Commissioner
intends to serve a monetary penalty notice. Subsection (4) (a)-(g) specifies the information
which a notice of intent must contain. The notice of intent must inform the person of their right
to make written submissions to the Commissioner or request an oral hearing within a specified
period. The specified period cannot be less than 21 days which begins on the day after the
notice is served.
467 Paragraph 4(6) requires the Commissioner to arrange an oral hearing if the person on whom
the notice is served makes this request during the specified period. At the hearing, the person
may make representations to explain interception activity which the Commissioner considers
was not acting in accordance with a warrant but which the warrant may explain. They may
also make representations to on other matters which they may be unable to disclose on appeal
by virtue of the criteria in Clause 43. If the Commissioner subsequently decides not to serve a
monetary penalty notice they must inform the person of that fact.
468 Paragraph 5 sets out procedure for variation or cancellation of a notice of intent. It specifies
that a Commissioner may not vary a notice of intent except to extend the specified period
during which the person on whom the notice is served may provide written submission or
request an oral hearing. This does not preclude the Commissioner from serving a new notice of
intent.
469 Paragraph 6 specifies that the Commissioner must not service a monetary penalty notice on
person if the notice of intent was served on that person more than three months earlier unless
the Commissioner considers it reasonable to do so and sets out the reasons in the monetary
penalty notice.
470 Paragraph 7 sets out procedure for variation or cancellation of a monetary penalty notice. The
Commissioner may not vary the notice in any way which disadvantages the person on who it
is served. If the monetary penalty is reduced or cancelled, any money already paid by the
person must be repaid. Where the Commissioner has cancelled a monetary penalty notice, he
or she cannot issue another notice on the person for the same interception activity.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
471 Paragraph 8 provides for a person to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal in respect of a monetary
penalty notice or any refusal to vary or cancel it. Subparagraph (2) specifies that a person
appealing against a monetary penalty notice does not have to comply with its provisions, with
the exception of any enforcement obligations, until the appeal is determined. The First Tier
Tribunal must allow the appeal if it considers the monetary penalty notice under appeal is not
lawful or where it considers the Commissioner has exercised discretion and ought to have
done so differently. Where the appeal is against a refusal to vary or cancel the notice,
subparagraphs (8)-(10) provide that the Tribunal may direct the Commissioner to make the
variation or cancellation if it considers the Commissioner ought to have done so.
472 Paragraph 9 specifies where a monetary penalty notice is recoverable in England, Wales and
Scotland.
473 Paragraph 10 specifies that any enforcement obligation contained in the monetary penalty
notice is enforceable by legal proceedings.
474 Paragraph 11 requires the Commissioner to produce guidance on the functions provided for
under Clause 6 and Schedule 1 and specifies that the guidance must set out the circumstances
under which the Commissioner would consider issuing a monetary penalty notice,
determining the amount payable and setting out in what circumstances it would be
appropriate to impose an enforcement obligation.
Part 2: Information Provisions
475 Paragraphs 13 and 14 provide for the Commissioner to issue an information notice in order to
determine whether a notice of intent or monetary penalty notice should be issued. Subsections
(3) and (4) set out the information which must be contained in an information notice and
specifies that the period within which the information is provided cannot be less than 28 days
beginning on the day after the notice is served. The Commissioner may vary an information
notice to extend the time within which the information is to be provided if the person on whom
the notice is serves appeals.
476 Paragraph 15 provides for a person to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal in respect of an
information notice or any refusal to vary or cancel it. Subject to the Commissioner extending
the time period, any appeal does not affect the need to comply with the information notice
until the outcome of the appeal is determined. The First Tier Tribunal must allow the appeal if
it considers the information notice under appeal is not lawful or where it considers the
Commissioner has exercised discretion and ought to have done so differently. Where the
appeal is against a refusal to vary or cancel the information notice, the Tribunal may direct the
Commissioner to make the variation or cancellation if it considers the Commissioner ought to
have done so.
477 Paragraph 16 provides for the Commissioner to serve a monetary penalty notice on a person
who refuses to comply or knowingly provides false material in response to an information
notice. Subparagraphs (2)-(5) set out the types of monetary penalty that the Commissioner may
require which must not exceed £10,000. If the Commissioner imposes a monetary penalty by
reference to a daily rate it may not start until after the day on which the notice is served and
must specify the period in which the amount starts to accrue, when it ceases to accumulate and
the period within which it must be repaid, which cannot be less than 28 days from the day the
amount starts to accumulate.
478 Paragraph 17 specifies the modifications applied to a monetary penalty notice issued under
Part 2 of the Schedule from a notice issued under Part 1. The provisions relating to
enforcement obligations do not apply to a Part 2 notice. The effect of paragraph 4 is modified to
specify that representations made at an appeal hearing of a Part 2 notice, outlined in
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
subparagraph (4), are only in relation to matters which they may be unable to disclose on
appeal by virtue of the criteria in Clause 43. Subparagraph (4) applies the criteria of paragraph
6 which specifies that the Commissioner must not service a monetary penalty notice on person
for failure to comply with a notice or for providing false information if the notice of intent was
served on that person more than three months earlier unless the Commissioner considers it
reasonable to do so and sets out the reasons in the monetary penalty notice. As in paragraph
7(5) the Commissioner may not issue another notice for the conduct outlined in paragraph
16(1)(a) or (b) if a previous notice has already been cancelled.
479 Paragraph 18 requires OFCOM to comply with any reasonable request in connection functions
under clause 6 or Schedule 1 and that in doing so the Commissioner may disclose any
information obtained under the provisions in the Schedule.
Schedule 2: Abolition of Disclosure Powers
480 Schedule 2 repeals certain powers so far as they enable public authorities to secure the
disclosure by a telecommunications operator of communications data without the consent of
the operator and ensures the definitions within these Acts have the same meaning as this Act.
481 Paragraph 1 requires an insertion to the end of section 20 of the Health and Safety at Work etc
Act 1974 to state that none of the section enables an inspector to secure disclosure of
communications data from a telecommunications operator or postal operator without the
operator’s consent.
482 Paragraph 2 requires an insertion after section 2(10) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987
(investigation powers of Director of Serious Fraud Office) to state that none of the section
enables a person to secure disclosure of communications data from a telecommunications
operator or postal operator without the operator’s consent.
483 Paragraph 3 requires an insertion to the end of section 29 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987
to state that the officer to whom the section relates may not use the power under the section to
secure disclosure of communications data from a telecommunications operator or postal
operator without the operator’s consent.
484 Paragraph 4 requires an insertion to the end of section 71 of the Environmental Protection Act
1990 to state that none of the section enables a person to secure disclosure of communications
data from a telecommunications operator or postal operator without the operator’s consent.
485 Paragraph 5(a)-(c) repeals section 109B (power to require information), subsection (2A)
paragraph (j) and subsection (2F) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. It amends
subsection (2E) of that Act to ensure the section does not enable a person to secure disclosure of
communications data from a telecommunications operator or postal operator without the
operator’s consent. Paragraph 6 applies the same abolition of disclosure powers to section 109C
(powers of entry) of the same Act.
486 Paragraph 7 requires an insertion after section 175, subsection (5) of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (information gathering and investigations: supplemental provision) to state
that nothing in the Part enables a person to secure disclosure of communications data from a
telecommunications operator or postal operator without the operator’s consent.
487 Paragraph 8 requires an insertion to the end of paragraph (19) (restrictions on powers: types of
information) of Schedule 36 of the Finance Act 2008 (information and inspections powers) to
state that an information notice does not require a telecommunications operator or postal
operator to provide or produce communications data.
488 Paragraph 9 sets outs the required deletions and substitutions to regulation 4 of the Prevention
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
of Social Housing Fraud (Power to Require Information) (England) Regulations 2014 (power to
require information from persons who provide telecommunications services etc) to repeal the
power to compel disclosure by a telecommunications operator of communications data
without the consent of the operator.
Schedule 3: Exceptions to Section 42
489 Schedule 2 sets out the exceptions to clause 42, which prohibits the disclosure of interception
for the purposes of or in connection with legal proceedings. The schedule sets out the
circumstances in which this prohibition would not apply.
490 Paragraph (2) provides that the contents of a communication may be disclosed if the
communication is obtained under a statutory power exercised to obtain information,
documents or property. This specifically applies to stored communications. It also allows
for disclosure of any lawful interception carried out in accordance with clauses 26-33.
491 Paragraph (3) provides that there is no prohibition to doing anything which discloses the
person has been convicted of offences under the Acts listed.
492 Paragraphs (4) and (5) specify that clause 42(1) does not apply in relation to proceedings before
the Investigatory Powers Tribunal or the Special Immigration Appeal Commission, providing
the conditions specified in sub-paragraph (5)(b)(i) or (ii) are met, which prohibits disclosure to
a SIAC applicant or representatives.
493 Paragraph (6) specifies that clause 42(1) does not apply in relation to proceedings before the
Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission, providing there is no disclosure to the persons
or bodies listed in sub-paragraph (6)(2).
494 Paragraph (7) specifies that clause 42(1) does not apply to certain civil proceedings where
provision for disclosure within closed material proceedings is made under section 14(1) of the
Justice and Security Act 2013.
495 Paragraphs (8) and (9) specify that clause 42(1) does not apply in any proceedings relating to
TPIMs or TEO providing there is no disclosure to any person involved or party to the
proceedings other than the Secretary of State.
496 Paragraphs (10)-(12) specifies that clause 42(1) does not apply into proceedings relating to the

502 Paragraph (20) lists the offences under relevant sections of specific Acts where clause 42(1)
does not apply.
503 Paragraph (21) provides that disclosure can be permitted during criminal proceedings to
prosecutors and judges in the interests of a fair prosecution. Sub-paragraph (4) makes
provisions for judges to direct the prosecution to make relevant admissions if, as a
consequence of the disclosure, the judge believes this is essential in the interests of justice as
longs as it does not contravene clause 42(1).
Schedule 4: Relevant Public Authorities
504 Column 1 of the table in Part 1 of this Schedule lists all the authorities that are able to acquire
communications data. Column 2 provides a minimum rank for designated senior officers.
These are the staff within the relevant public authorities that are able to authorise the
acquisition of communications data. Columns 3 and 4 provide the types of data that each
designated senior officer is able to authorise the acquisition of and the statutory purposes,
listed in clause 46(7), for which it can be accessed.
505 Many authorities are only able to acquire communications data for the purpose of preventing
or detecting crime or of preventing disorder. Certain purposes only apply to certain
authorities. For example, the purpose of exercising functions relating to the regulation of
financial services and markets or to financial stability only applies to the Financial Conduct
Authority.
506 Some authorities have two designated senior officers at different ranks. This is because 'entity'
data is generally less intrusive than 'events' data and can therefore be acquired at a lower
authorisation level. For example, in police forces, an Inspector can authorise acquisition of
'entity' and 'reference’ data, whereas a Superintendent can authorise acquisition of all types of
communications data. Where only one rank of designated senior officer is provided for, that
rank is deemed to be senior enough to authorise acquisition of all types of communications
data.
Schedule 5: Transfer and Agency Arrangements with Public
Authorities: Further Provisions
507 This clauses outlines the provisions that apply should the Home Secretary transfer ownership
of the Request Filter to a public authority. Subparagraph (2) requires the Secretary of State to
approve the measures to be adopted by a designated public authority for complying with the
requirements in clause 67(1). A designated public authority must send the reports required
under paragraph (2) to the Secretary of State as well as to the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner.
508 Paragraph 3 sets out that the Secretary of State, in connection with regulations made under
clause 67(1), may make a scheme for the transfer of property, rights or liabilities (including
rights and liabilities relating to contracts of employment). Such transfers may be from the
Secretary of State (in practice, the Home Office) to a designated public authority or from one
designated public authority to the Secretary of State or to another designated public authority.
509 Sub-paragraph (3) lists consequential, supplementary, incidental and transitional provision
that may be made by a transfer scheme. These include making provision the same as or
similar to the TUPE regulations (the Transfer of Undertakings (Protections of Employment)
Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/246). By virtue of sub-paragraph (5), a scheme may make provision
for the payment of compensation, example to a designated public authority in circumstances
where functions conferred on that body are brought back within the Home Office.
Sub-paragraph (6) provides that a transfer scheme may either be included in regulations made
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
under clause 67(1) but even if not, must be laid before Parliament after being made.
510 Paragraph 4 provides a power for the Treasury to make regulations providing for the tax
consequences of a transfer scheme made under paragraph 3. For the purposes of this power
the relevant taxes are income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty and stamp
duty reserve tax.
Schedule 6: Codes of Practice
511 Paragraph 1 requires the Secretary of State to issues codes of practice in respect of the exercise
of functions under Parts 1-7 of the Bill but not in relation to any functions of any Part conferred
on the individuals or bodies listed in subparagraph (a)-(f).
512 Paragraph 2 specifies that a code of practice about the functions in Part 2 of the Bill must cover
arrangements for the disclosure and handling of intercepted material to overseas authorities. It
must also cover the process for making sharing requests to overseas authorities for intercepted
material obtained through a postal or telecommunications system and handling arrangements
for any material obtained.
513 Paragraph 3 requires a code of practice to cover communications data held by public
authorities acquired under the powers provided by Part 3. Subsection 2 specifies that the code
of practice must explain the criteria listed in (a)-(f) covering why the data is held, access to the
data, disclosure of the data, interrogation of the data and destruction of the data.
514 Paragraph 4 specifies that a code of practice about obtaining or retaining relevant
communications data under the powers provided by Part 3 must also include provisions
designed to protect the confidentiality of journalistic sources. It should also outline particular
considerations which should be applied to data relating to a member of a profession which
would regularly hold legally privileged or relevant confidential information, such as medical
professionals, those in the legal profession or MPs. Both legally privileged information and
confidential information are defined in subparagraph 2.
515 Paragraph 5 specifies that the Secretary of State must consult on any draft code of practice but
may modify a code on the basis of representations made after its publication. The Secretary of
State must specifically consult the Investigatory Powers Commissioner on the draft code. A
code come into force in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State, which
must be made by statutory instrument and laid in draft before Parliament and approved by
each House. The draft code should be laid alongside the draft instrument. No statutory
instrument can be laid until the consultation has taken place.
516 Paragraph 6 makes provision for the Secretary of State to make revisions to a code of practice.
The Secretary of State is required to publish and consult on the revised code, and in particular,
the Investigatory Powers Commissioner must be consulted. A revised code comes into force
in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State, which must be made by
statutory instrument and laid before Parliament. The revised code should be laid alongside the
draft instrument. No statutory instrument can be laid until the consultation on the revised code
has taken place.
517 Paragraph 7 requires a person exercising any function to which a code relates to have due
regard for the code. Subparagraph (2) clarifies that failure to comply with the code does not
make a person liable to criminal or civil proceedings. Subparagraphs (3) and (4) specify
however, that the code can be admissible in evidence in any such legal proceedings and a court
or tribunal may take a person’s failure to comply with the code into account in determining a
question in such proceedings.
Schedule 7: Combination of Warrants
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Investigatory Powers Bill as published in Draft on 4 November 2015 (Cm
9152)
518 This schedule allows for warrants authorising different powers to be combined in the same
warrant instrument. Those requesting a warrant are under no obligation to apply for a
combined warrant and may still apply for individual warrants if that is more operationally
efficient. Part 1 explains combinations with targeted interception warrants. Subsections (1)-(3)
detail that the Secretary of State may issue a combined warrant on behalf of the Security and
Intelligence Agencies. Subsection (4) outlines that the Secretary of State may issue a combined
warrant where one of the constituent parts of the combined warrant authorises targeted
interception on behalf of the listed Law Enforcement Agencies.
519 Part 2 explains how other combinations of warrants are permitted in terms of combinations
with targeted equipment warrants. Subsections (5)-(7) relate to combining an intelligence
service equipment interference warrant with various other authorisations / warrants (both
within this Bill – a targeted examination warrant; and within RIPA – a directed surveillance or
intrusive surveillance authorisation – and the Intelligence Services Act1994 in terms of a
property interference warrant under section 5). Subsection (9) provides for law enforcement to
combine a targeted equipment interference warrant with a directed or intrusive surveillance
authorisation or a police property interference authorisation (under the Police Act 1997).
520 Part 3 provides some general points on how combined warrants should operate. Subsection (9)
provides some interpretations.
521 Subsections (10)-(14) confirm that the procedure for issue of these warrants conforms to the
issue of its constituent parts. Therefore, regardless of who issues the warrant, where two or
more powers are authorised under the same warrant then the authorisation of that warrant
will be subject to approval by a Judicial Commissioner. Subsection (11) makes clear that a
request for a combined warrant may only be put forward if those applying for the warrant are
able to apply for each constituent part of that warrant as an individual warrant. Subsection (12)
makes clear that the duration of the combined warrant is determined by the constituent part of
the combined warrant which would end first.
522 Combined warrants will still contain all of the information that would be required should the
constituent parts of that warrant be applied for individually. Similarly the protections and
safeguards that apply to material gathered under a combined warrant will still apply as
relevant to the constituent parts of the combined warrant.
Schedule 8: Transitional, Transitory and Saving Provision
523 Schedule 8 explains transitional, transitory and saving provisions for the Bill. Paragraph 1
provides for agreements in force under section 1(4) of RIPA to be considered as international
mutual assistance agreements on the day the Act comes in to force, by the virtue of the
regulations under section 7 of this Bill.
524 Paragraph 2 specifies how provisions in force under DRIPA 2014 should be transferred under
the Bill upon enactment and remain in force.
Schedule 9: Minor and Consequential Provision
525 Schedule 9 makes minor and consequential amendments to other enactments.
Commencement
526 Clauses 193 to 199, 200(2), 201(2) and (3) and 202 and Part 9 of the Bill will commence on Royal
Assent. The main provisions of the Bill will be brought into force by means of regulations made
by the Secretary of State.

Financial implications of the Bill
527 The provisions enabled by the Bill is estimated to lead to an increase in public expenditure of
£247 million over 10 years from 2015/16. These costs are based on:
a.
costs to Government Departments associated with the establishment of the
Investigatory Powers Commission and authorisation of warrantry;
b.
costs associated with the ongoing running costs, compliance and reimbursement to
business of costs associated with new communications data provisions;
c.
costs associated with increased compliance, reporting and safeguards to the agencies,
law enforcement and other public authorities;
d. costs to the justice system for offences and changes to the Investigatory Powers
Tribunal.
Compatibility with the European Convention on
Human Rights
528 The Government is satisfied that, in the event that the Bill is introduced into Parliament, the
responsible Minister could make a statement under section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act
1998 that, in the Minister’s view, the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the Convention
rights.
529 The Government has published a separate ECHR memorandum which explains its assessment
of the compatibility of the Bill's provisions with the Convention rights; the memorandum is
available on the Home Office website.
