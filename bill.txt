(whether by the sender or otherwise) for the purposes of any postal
service by means of which it is being or may be transmitted, or
(b) any conduct, in connection with conduct falling within paragraph (a),
that gives a person who is neither the sender nor the intended recipient
only so much access to a communication as is necessary for the purpose
of identifying such postal data.

authorised by a targeted equipment interference warrant if the applicant
considers that the conduct would (unless done under lawful authority)
constitute one or more offences under sections 1 to 3A of the Computer Misuse
Act 1990 (computer misuse offences).

PART 4
RETENTION OF COMMUNICATIONS DATA
General
Powers to require retention of certain data

communication, the day of the communication concerned,
(b) in the case of entity data which does not fall within paragraph (a) above
but does fall within paragraph (a)(i) of the definition of
“communications data” in section 223(5), the day on which the entity
concerned ceases to be associated with the telecommunications service
concerned or (if earlier) the day on which the data is changed, and
(c) in any other case, the day on which the data is first held by the operator
concerned.
(4)
A retention notice which relates to data already in existence when the notice
comes into force imposes a requirement to retain the data for only so much of
a period of retention as occurs on or after the coming into force of the notice.
(5)
A retention notice comes into force—
(a) when the notice is given to the operator (or description of operators)
concerned, or
(b) (if later) at the time or times specified in the notice.
(6)
(7)
A retention notice is given to an operator (or description of operators) by
giving, or publishing, it in such manner as the Secretary of State considers
appropriate for bringing it to the attention of the operator (or description of
operators) to whom it relates.
A retention notice must specify—
(a) the operator (or description of operators) to whom it relates,
(b) the data which is to be retained,

Safeguards
Matters to be taken into account before giving retention notices
(1)
(2)
Before giving a retention notice, the Secretary of State must, among other
matters, take into account—
(a) the likely benefits of the notice,
(b) the likely number of users (if known) of any telecommunications
service to which the notice relates,
(c) the technical feasibility of complying with the notice,
(d) the likely cost of complying with the notice, and
(e) any other effect of the notice on the telecommunications operator (or
description of operators) to whom it relates.
Before giving such a notice, the Secretary of State must take reasonable steps to
consult any operator to whom it relates.
Review by the Secretary of State
(1)
A telecommunications operator to whom a retention notice is given may,
within such period or circumstances as may be provided for by regulations
made by the Secretary of State, refer the notice back to the Secretary of State.
(2)
Such a reference may be in relation to the whole of a notice or any aspect of it.
(3)
In the case of a notice given to a description of operators—
(a)
(b)
each operator falling within that description may make a reference
under subsection (1), but
each such reference may only be in relation to the notice, or aspect of
the notice, so far as it applies to that operator.
(4)
There is no requirement for an operator who has referred a retention notice
under subsection (1) to comply with the notice, so far as referred, until the
Secretary of State has reviewed the notice in accordance with subsection (5).
(5)
The Secretary of State must review any notice so far as referred to the Secretary
of State under subsection (1).
(6)
Before deciding the review, the Secretary of State must consult—
(a) the Technical Advisory Board, and
(b) the Investigatory Powers Commissioner.
(7)
The Board must consider the technical requirements and the financial
consequences, for the operator who has made the reference, of the notice so far
as referred.
(8)
The Commissioner must consider whether the notice so far as referred is
proportionate.
(9)
The Board and the Commissioner must—
(a) give the operator concerned and the Secretary of State the opportunity
to provide evidence, or make representations, to them before reaching
their conclusions,
(b) report their conclusions to—
(i) the operator, and
(ii) the Secretary of State.
(10)
The Secretary of State may, after considering the conclusions of the Board and
the Commissioner—
(a) vary or revoke the retention notice under section 83, or
(b) give a notice under this section to the operator concerned confirming its
effect.
(11)
A report or notice under this section is given to an operator by giving or
publishing it in such manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for
bringing it to the attention of the operator.
(12)
The Secretary of State must keep a retention notice under review (whether or
not referred under subsection (1)).
Data integrity and security
(1)
A telecommunications operator who retains relevant communications data by
virtue of this Part must—
(a) secure that the data is of the same integrity, and subject to at least the
same security and protection, as the data on any system from which it
is derived,
(b) secure, by appropriate technical and organisational measures, that the
data can be accessed only by specially authorised personnel, and
(c) protect, by appropriate technical and organisational measures, the data
against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration,
or unauthorised or unlawful retention, processing, access or disclosure.
(2)
A telecommunications operator who retains relevant communications data by
virtue of this Part must destroy the data if the retention of the data ceases to be
authorised by virtue of this Part and is not otherwise authorised by law.
(3)
The destruction of the data may take place at such monthly or shorter intervals
as appear to the operator to be practicable.
Disclosure of retained data
A telecommunications operator must put in place adequate security systems
(including technical and organisational measures) governing access to relevant
communications data retained by virtue of this Part in order to protect against
any unlawful disclosure.
Variation or revocation of notices
Variation or revocation of notices
(1)
The Secretary of State may vary a retention notice.
(2)
The Secretary of State must give, or publish, notice of the variation in such
manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for bringing the
variation to the attention of the telecommunications operator (or description of
operators) to whom it relates.
(3)
A variation comes into force—
(a) when notice of it is given or published in accordance with subsection
(2), or
(b) (if later) at the time or times specified in the notice of variation.
(4)
A retention notice may not be varied so as to require the retention of additional
relevant communications data unless the Secretary of State considers that the
requirement is necessary and proportionate for one or more of the purposes
falling within paragraphs (a) to (j) of section 53(7) (purposes for which
communications data may be obtained).
(5)
Section 78(2) and (4) apply in relation to a retention notice as varied as they
apply in relation to a retention notice, but as if the references to the notice
coming into force included references to the variation coming into force.
(6)
Sections 78(3) and (7), 84 and 86, and subsections (1), (4), (9) and (12) of this
section, apply in relation to a retention notice as varied as they apply in relation
to a retention notice.
(7)
Section 79 applies in relation to the making of a variation as it applies in
relation to the giving of a retention notice.
(8)
Section 80 applies (but only so far as the variation is concerned) in relation to a
retention notice as varied (other than one varied as mentioned in subsection
(10)(a) of that section) as it applies in relation to a retention notice.
(9)
The Secretary of State may revoke (whether wholly or in part) a retention
notice.
(10)
The Secretary of State must give or publish notice of the revocation in such
manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for bringing the
revocation to the attention of the operator (or description of operators) to
whom it relates.
(11)
(12)
A revocation comes into force—
(a) when notice of it is given or published in accordance with subsection
(10), or
(b) (if later) at the time or times specified in the notice of revocation.
The fact that a retention notice has been revoked in relation to a particular
description of communications data and a particular operator (or description
of operators) does not prevent the giving of another retention notice in relation
to the same description of data and the same operator (or description of
operators).
Enforcement
Enforcement of notices and certain other requirements and restrictions
(1)
It is the duty of a telecommunications operator on whom a requirement or
restriction is imposed by—
(a) a retention notice, or
(b) section 81 or 82,
to comply with the requirement or restriction.
(2)
A telecommunications operator, or any person employed or engaged for the
purposes of the business of a telecommunications operator, must not disclose
the existence or contents of a retention notice to any other person.
(3)
The Information Commissioner, or any member of staff of the Information
Commissioner, must not disclose the existence or contents of a retention notice
to any other person.
(4)
Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to a disclosure made with the permission
of the Secretary of State.
(5)
The duty under subsection (1) or (2) is enforceable by civil proceedings by the
Secretary of State for an injunction, or for specific performance of a statutory
duty under section 45 of the Court of Session Act 1988, or for any other
appropriate relief.

postal operator,
(b) any reference to a telecommunications service were a reference to a
postal service,
(c) any reference to a telecommunication system were a reference to a
postal service,

data” in section 224(3), the day on which the person
concerned leaves the postal service concerned or (if
earlier) the day on which the data is changed,”, and
in section 78(9), the words from “and this expression” to the end were
omitted.
Extra-territorial application of Part 4
(1)
A retention notice, and any requirement or restriction imposed by virtue of a
retention notice or by section 81, 82 or 84(1) to (3), may relate to conduct outside

described in the warrant, of anything obtained under the warrant by
virtue of paragraph (a).
The reference in subsections (2) and (3) to the obtaining of communications or
other information includes doing so by—
(a) monitoring, observing or listening to a person’s communications or
other activities;
(b) recording anything which is monitored, observed or listened to.
A targeted equipment interference warrant also authorises the following
conduct (in addition to the conduct described in the warrant)—
(a) any conduct which it is necessary to undertake in order to do what is
expressly authorised or required by the warrant, including conduct for
securing the obtaining of communications, equipment data or other
information;
(b) any conduct by any person which is conduct in pursuance of a
requirement imposed by or on behalf of the person to whom the
warrant is addressed to be provided with assistance in giving effect to
the warrant.
A targeted equipment interference warrant may not, by virtue of subsection
(3), authorise or require a person to engage in conduct, in relation to a
communication other than a stored communication, which would (unless done
with lawful authority) constitute an offence under section 2(1) (unlawful
interception).
(7)
Subsection (5)(a) does not authorise a person to engage in conduct which could
not be expressly authorised under the warrant because of the restriction
imposed by subsection (6).
(8)
In subsection (6), “stored communication” means a communication stored in or
by a telecommunication system (whether before or after its transmission).
(9)
A targeted examination warrant is a warrant which authorises the person to

under a bulk equipment interference warrant for examination, in breach of the
prohibition in section 170(4) (prohibition on seeking to identify
communications of, or private information relating to, individuals in the
British Islands).
In this Part, “protected material”, in relation to a targeted examination warrant,
means any material obtained under a bulk equipment interference warrant
under Chapter 3 of Part 6, other than material which is—
(a) equipment data;
(b) information (other than a communication or equipment data) which is
not private information.
(10)
For provision enabling the combination of targeted equipment interference
warrants with certain other warrants or authorisations (including targeted
examination warrants), see Schedule 8.
(11)
Any conduct which is carried out in accordance with a warrant under this Part
is lawful for all purposes.
Meaning of “equipment data”

of, attached to or logically associated with a communication (whether
by the sender or otherwise) or any other item of information,
(b) is capable of being logically separated from the remainder of the
communication or the item of information, and
(c) if it were so separated, would not reveal anything of what might
reasonably be considered to be the meaning (if any) of the
communication or the item of information, disregarding any meaning
arising from the fact of the communication or the existence of the item
of information or from any data relating to that fact.
(3)
In subsection (2), “relevant system” means any system on or by means of which
the data is held.
(4)
For the meaning of “systems data” and “identifying data”, see section 225.

take into account—
(a) the likely benefits of the warrant,
(b) the likely number of users (if known) of any telecommunications
service which is provided by the operator and to which the warrant
relates,
(c) the technical feasibility of complying with any requirement that may be
imposed on the operator to provide assistance in giving effect to the
warrant,
(d) the likely cost of complying with any such requirement, and
(e) any other effect of the warrant on the operator.
(1)
Approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners
In deciding whether to approve a decision to issue a warrant under section 121,
a Judicial Commissioner must review the Secretary of State’s conclusions as to
the following matters—
(a) whether the warrant is necessary as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) of
that section,
(b) whether the conduct that would be authorised by the warrant is
proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct,
(c) whether—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 125) is a
purpose for which the examination of intercepted content or
secondary data obtained under the warrant is or may be
necessary, and
(ii) the examination of intercepted content or secondary data for
each such purpose is necessary as mentioned in section
(d) any matters taken into account in accordance with section 122.
(2)
In doing so, the Judicial Commissioner must apply the same principles as
would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review.
(3)
Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a decision to issue a
warrant under section 121, the Judicial Commissioner must give the Secretary
of State written reasons for the refusal.
(4)
Where a Judicial Commissioner, other than the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner, refuses to approve a decision to issue a warrant under section
decide whether to approve the decision to issue the warrant.
The decision to issue a bulk interception warrant must be taken personally by
the Secretary of State.
(2)
Before a bulk interception warrant is issued, it must be signed by the Secretary
of State.
Requirements that must be met by warrants
(1)
A bulk interception warrant must contain a provision stating that it is a bulk
interception warrant.
(2)
A bulk interception warrant must be addressed to the head of the intelligence
service by whom, or on whose behalf, the application for the warrant was
made.
(3)
A bulk interception warrant must specify the operational purposes for which
any intercepted content or secondary data obtained under the warrant may be
selected for examination.
(4)
Decisions to issue warrants to be taken personally by Secretary of State
(1)
In specifying any operational purposes, it is not sufficient simply to use the
descriptions contained in section 121(1)(b) or (2), but the purposes may still be
general purposes.
(5)
The warrant may, in particular, specify all of the operational purposes which,
at the time the warrant is issued, the person to whom it is addressed considers
are operational purposes for which intercepted content or secondary data
obtained under bulk interception warrants may be selected for examination.
(6)
In this Chapter “the specified operational purposes”, in relation to a bulk
interception warrant, means the operational purposes specified in the warrant
in accordance with this section.
Duration, modification and cancellation of warrants
(1)
(2)
(1)
(2)
(3)
Duration of warrants
A bulk interception warrant (unless already cancelled) ceases to have effect at
the end of the period of 6 months beginning with—
(a) the day on which the warrant was issued, or
(b) in the case of a warrant that has been renewed, the day after the day at
the end of which the warrant would have ceased to have effect if it had
not been renewed.
For provision about the renewal of warrants, see section 127.
Renewal of warrants
If the renewal conditions are met, a bulk interception warrant may be renewed,
at any time before it would otherwise cease to have effect, by an instrument
issued by the Secretary of State.
This is subject to subsection (5).
The renewal conditions are—
(a) that the Secretary of State considers that the warrant continues to be
necessary—
(i) in the interests of national security, or
(ii) on that ground and on any other grounds falling within section
(b) that the Secretary of State considers that the conduct that would be
authorised by the renewed warrant continues to be proportionate to
what is sought to be achieved by that conduct,
(c) that the Secretary of State considers that—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 125) is a
purpose for which the examination of intercepted content or
secondary data obtained under the warrant continues to be, or
may be, necessary, and
(ii) the examination of intercepted content or secondary data for
each such purpose continues to be necessary on any of the
grounds on which the Secretary of State considers that the
warrant continues to be necessary, and
(d) that the decision to renew the warrant has been approved by a Judicial
Commissioner.
The decision to renew a bulk interception warrant must be taken personally by
the Secretary of State, and the instrument renewing the warrant must be signed
by the Secretary of State.
(4)
Section 123 (approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners) applies in
relation to a decision to renew a bulk interception warrant as it applies in
relation to a decision to issue a bulk interception warrant.
This is subject to subsection (5).
(5)
In the case of the renewal of a bulk interception warrant that has been modified
so that it no longer authorises or requires the interception of communications
or the obtaining of secondary data—
(a) the renewal condition in subsection (2)(a) is to be disregarded,
(b) the reference in subsection (2)(c)(ii) to the grounds on which the
Secretary of State considers the warrant to be necessary is to be read as
a reference to any grounds falling within section 121(1)(b) or (2), and
(c) section 123 has effect as if—
(i) paragraph (a) of subsection (1) were omitted, and
(ii) the reference in subsection (1)(c)(ii) to the grounds on which the
Secretary of State considers the warrant to be necessary were a
reference to any grounds falling within section 121(1)(b) or (2).
Modification of warrants
(1)
The provisions of a bulk interception warrant may be modified at any time by
an instrument issued by the person making the modification.
(2)
The only modifications that may be made under this section are—
(a) adding, varying or removing any operational purpose specified in the
warrant as a purpose for which any intercepted content or secondary
data obtained under the warrant may be selected for examination, and
(b) providing that the warrant no longer authorises or requires—
(i) the interception of any communications in the course of their
transmission by means of a telecommunication system, or
(ii) the obtaining of any secondary data from communications
transmitted by means of such a system.
(3)
In this section—
(a) a modification adding or varying any operational purpose as
mentioned in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) is referred to as a “major
modification”, and
(b) any other modification within that subsection is referred to as a “minor
modification”.
(4)
A major modification—
(a) must be made by the Secretary of State, and
(b) may be made only if the Secretary of State considers that it is necessary
on any of the grounds on which the Secretary of State considers the
warrant to be necessary (see section 121(1)(b)).
(5)
Except where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent need to
make the modification, a major modification has effect only if the decision to
make the modification is approved by a Judicial Commissioner.
(6)
Section 123 (approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners) applies in
relation to a decision to make a major modification of a bulk interception
warrant as it applies in relation to the decision to issue a bulk interception
warrant.
Section 129 contains provision about the approval of major modifications made
in urgent cases.
(7)
A minor modification may be made by—
(a) the Secretary of State, or
(b) a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of State.
(8)
Where a minor modification is made by a senior official, the Secretary of State
must be notified personally of the modification and the reasons for making it.
(9)
If at any time a person mentioned in subsection (7) considers that any
operational purpose specified in a warrant is no longer a purpose for which the
examination of intercepted content or secondary data obtained under the
warrant is or may be necessary, the person must modify the warrant by
removing that operational purpose.
The decision to modify the provisions of a warrant must be taken personally
by the person making the modification, and the instrument making the
modification must be signed by that person.
This is subject to subsection (11) (urgent cases).
In a case where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent need to
make a major modification—
(a) the instrument making the modification may be signed by a senior
official designated by the Secretary of State for that purpose, and
(b) the instrument must contain a statement that the case is an urgent case
in which the Secretary of State has personally and expressly authorised
the making of the modification.
(12)
Despite section 119(2), the modification of a bulk interception warrant as
mentioned in subsection (2)(b) above does not prevent the warrant from being
a bulk interception warrant.
(13)
Nothing in this section applies in relation to modifying the provisions of a
warrant in a way which does not affect the conduct authorised or required by
it.
(10)
(11)
(1)
Approval of major modifications made in urgent cases
This section applies where—
(a) the Secretary of State makes a major modification of a bulk interception
warrant without the approval of a Judicial Commissioner, and
(b) the Secretary of State considered that there was an urgent need to make
the modification.
(2)
The Secretary of State must inform a Judicial Commissioner that the
modification has been made.
(3)
The Judicial Commissioner must, before the end of the relevant period—
(a) decide whether to approve the decision to make the modification, and
(b) notify the Secretary of State of the Judicial Commissioner’s decision.
“The relevant period” means the period ending with the fifth working day after
the day on which the modification was made.
(4)
If the Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve the decision to make the
modification—
(a)
(b)
(5)
the warrant (unless it no longer has effect) has effect as if the
modification had not been made, and
the person to whom the warrant is addressed must, so far as is
reasonably practicable, secure that anything in the process of being
done under the warrant by virtue of that modification stops as soon as
possible.
Nothing in this section affects the lawfulness of—
(a) anything done under the warrant by virtue of the modification before
the modification ceases to have effect;
(b) if anything is in the process of being done under the warrant by virtue
of the modification when the modification ceases to have effect—
(i) anything done before that thing could be stopped, or
(ii) anything done which it is not reasonably practicable to stop.
Cancellation of warrants
(1)
The Secretary of State, or a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of
State, may cancel a bulk interception warrant at any time.
(2)
If the Secretary of State, or a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of
State, considers that any of the cancellation conditions are met in relation to a
bulk interception warrant, the person must cancel the warrant.
(3)
The cancellation conditions are—
(a) that the warrant is no longer necessary in the interests of national
security;
(b) that the conduct authorised by the warrant is no longer proportionate
to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct;
(c) that the examination of intercepted content or secondary data obtained
under the warrant is no longer necessary for any of the specified
operational purposes (see section 125).
(4)
But the condition in subsection (3)(a) does not apply where the warrant has
been modified so that it no longer authorises or requires the interception of
communications or the obtaining of secondary data.
(5)
Where a warrant is cancelled under this section, the person to whom the
warrant was addressed must, so far as is reasonably practicable, secure that
anything in the process of being done under the warrant stops as soon as
possible.
(6)
A warrant that has been cancelled under this section may not be renewed.
Implementation of warrants
(1)
Implementation of warrants
In giving effect to a bulk interception warrant, the person to whom it is
addressed (“the implementing authority”) may (in addition to acting alone) act
through, or together with, such other persons as the implementing authority
may require (whether under subsection (2) or otherwise) to provide the
authority with assistance in giving effect to the warrant.
(2)
For the purpose of requiring any person to provide assistance in relation to a
bulk interception warrant, the implementing authority may—
(a) serve a copy of the warrant on any person who the implementing
authority considers may be able to provide such assistance, or
(b) make arrangements for the service of a copy of the warrant on any such
person.
(3)
A copy of a warrant may be served under subsection (2) on a person outside
the United Kingdom for the purpose of requiring the person to provide such
assistance in the form of conduct outside the United Kingdom.
(4)
For the purposes of this Act, the provision of assistance in giving effect to a
bulk interception warrant includes any disclosure to the implementing
authority, or to persons acting on behalf of the implementing authority, of
anything obtained under the warrant.
(5)
Sections 35 (service of warrants outside the United Kingdom) and 36 (duty of
operators to assist with implementation) apply in relation to a bulk
interception warrant as they apply in relation to a targeted interception
warrant.
(6)
References in this section (and in sections 35 and 36 as they apply in relation to
bulk interception warrants) to the service of a copy of a warrant include—
(a) the service of a copy of one or more schedules contained in the warrant
with the omission of the remainder of the warrant, and
(b) the service of a copy of the warrant with the omission of any schedule
contained in the warrant.
Restrictions on use or disclosure of material obtained under warrants etc.
(1)
(2)
(3)
Safeguards relating to retention and disclosure of material
The Secretary of State must ensure, in relation to every bulk interception
warrant, that arrangements are in force for securing—
(a) that the requirements of subsections (2) and (5) are met in relation to the
material obtained under the warrant, and
(b) that the requirements of section 134 are met in relation to the
intercepted content or secondary data obtained under the warrant.
This is subject to subsection (8).
The requirements of this subsection are met in relation to the material obtained
under a warrant if each of the following is limited to the minimum that is
necessary for the authorised purposes (see subsection (3))—
(a) the number of persons to whom any of the material is disclosed or
otherwise made available;
(b) the extent to which any of the material is disclosed or otherwise made
available;
(c) the extent to which any of the material is copied;
(d) the number of copies that are made.
For the purposes of subsection (2) something is necessary for the authorised
purposes if, and only if—
(a) it is, or is likely to become, necessary in the interests of national security
or on any other grounds falling within section 121(2),
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)
it is necessary for facilitating the carrying out of any functions under
this Act of the Secretary of State, the Scottish Ministers or the head of
the intelligence service to whom the warrant is or was addressed,
it is necessary for facilitating the carrying out of any functions of the
Judicial Commissioners or the Investigatory Powers Tribunal under or
in relation to this Act,
it is necessary to ensure that a person (“P”) who is conducting a
criminal prosecution has the information P needs to determine what is
required of P by P’s duty to secure the fairness of the prosecution, or
it is necessary for the performance of any duty imposed on any person
by the Public Records Act 1958 or the Public Records Act (Northern
Ireland) 1923.
The arrangements for the time being in force under this section for securing
that the requirements of subsection (2) are met in relation to the material
obtained under the warrant must include arrangements for securing that every
copy made of any of that material is stored, for so long as it is retained, in a
secure manner.
The requirements of this subsection are met in relation to the material obtained
under a warrant if every copy made of any of that material (if not destroyed
earlier) is destroyed as soon as there are no longer any relevant grounds for
retaining it (see subsection (6)).
For the purposes of subsection (5), there are no longer any relevant grounds for
retaining a copy of any material if, and only if—
(a) its retention is not necessary, or not likely to become necessary, in the
interests of national security or on any other grounds falling within
section 121(2), and
(b) its retention is not necessary for any of the purposes mentioned in
paragraphs (b) to (e) of subsection (3) above.
Subsection (8) applies if—
(a) any material obtained under the warrant has been handed over to any
overseas authorities, or
(b) a copy of any such material has been given to any overseas authorities.
To the extent that the requirements of subsections (2) and (5) relate to any of
the material mentioned in subsection (7)(a), or to the copy mentioned in
subsection (7)(b), the arrangements made for the purposes of this section are
not required to secure that those requirements are met (see instead section 133).
In this section—
“copy”, in relation to material obtained under a warrant, means any of the
following (whether or not in documentary form)—
(a) any copy, extract or summary of the material which identifies
the material as having been obtained under the warrant, and
(b) any record which—
(i) refers to any interception or to the obtaining of any
material, and
(ii) is a record of the identities of the persons to or by whom
the material was sent, or to whom the material relates,
and “copied” is to be read accordingly;
“overseas authorities” means authorities of a country or territory outside
the United Kingdom.
(1)
(2)
Safeguards relating to disclosure of material overseas
The Secretary of State must ensure, in relation to every bulk interception
warrant, that arrangements are in force for securing that—
(a) any material obtained under the warrant is handed over to overseas
authorities only if the requirements of subsection (2) are met, and
(b) copies of any such material are given to overseas authorities only if
those requirements are met.
The requirements of this subsection are met in the case of a warrant if it appears
to the Secretary of State—
(a) that requirements corresponding to the requirements of section 132(2)
and (5) (“the relevant requirements”) will apply, to such extent (if any)
as the Secretary of State considers appropriate, in relation to any of the
material which is handed over, or any copy of which is given, to the
authorities in question, and
(b) that restrictions are in force which would prevent, to such extent (if
any) as the Secretary of State considers appropriate, the doing of
anything in, for the purposes of or in connection with any proceedings
outside the United Kingdom which would result in a prohibited
disclosure.
(3)
In subsection (2)(b) “prohibited disclosure” means a disclosure which, if made
in the United Kingdom, would breach the prohibition in section 48(1) (see
section 136).
(4)
In this section—
“copy” has the same meaning as in section 132;
“overseas authorities” means authorities of a country or territory outside
the United Kingdom.
(1)
(2)
(3)
Safeguards relating to examination of material
For the purposes of section 132 the requirements of this section are met in
relation to the intercepted content and secondary data obtained under a
warrant if—
(a) any selection of the intercepted content or secondary data for
examination is carried out only for the specified purposes (see
subsection (2)),
(b) the selection of any of the intercepted content or secondary data for
examination is necessary and proportionate in all the circumstances,
and
(c) the selection of any of the intercepted content for examination meets
any of the selection conditions (see subsection (3)).
The selection of intercepted content or secondary data for examination is
carried out only for the specified purposes if the intercepted content or
secondary data is selected for examination only so far as is necessary for the
operational purposes specified in the warrant in accordance with section 125.
In this subsection “specified in the warrant” means specified in the warrant at
the time of the selection of the intercepted content or secondary data for
examination.
The selection conditions referred to in subsection (1)(c) are—
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(4)
(5)
that the selection of the intercepted content for examination does not
breach the prohibition in subsection (4);
that the person to whom the warrant is addressed considers that the
selection of the intercepted content for examination would not breach
that prohibition;
that the selection of the intercepted content for examination in breach
of that prohibition is authorised by subsection (5);
that the selection of the intercepted content for examination in breach
of that prohibition is authorised by a targeted examination warrant
issued under Chapter 1 of Part 2.
The prohibition referred to in subsection (3)(a) is that intercepted content may
not at any time be selected for examination if—
(a) any criteria used for the selection of the intercepted content for
examination are referable to an individual known to be in the British
Islands at that time, and
(b) the purpose of using those criteria is to identify the content of
communications sent by, or intended for, that individual.
It does not matter for the purposes of this subsection whether the identity of
the individual is known.
The selection of intercepted content (“the relevant content”) for examination is
authorised by this subsection if—
(a) criteria referable to an individual have been, or are being, used for the
selection of intercepted content for examination in circumstances
falling within subsection (3)(a) or (b),
(b) at any time it appears to the person to whom the warrant is addressed
that there has been a relevant change of circumstances in relation to the
individual (see subsection (6)) which would mean that the selection of
the relevant content for examination would breach the prohibition in
subsection (4),
(c) since that time, a written authorisation to examine the relevant content
using those criteria has been given by a senior officer, and
(d) the selection of the relevant content for examination is made before the
end of the permitted period (see subsection (7)).
(6)
For the purposes of subsection (5)(b) there is a relevant change of
circumstances in relation to an individual if—
(a) the individual has entered the British Islands, or
(b) a belief by the person to whom the warrant is addressed that the
individual was outside the British Islands was in fact mistaken.
(7)
In subsection (5)—
“senior officer”, in relation to a warrant addressed to the head of an
intelligence service, means a member of the intelligence service who—
(a) is a member of the Senior Civil Service or a member of the
Senior Management Structure of Her Majesty’s Diplomatic
Service, or
(b) holds a position in the intelligence service of equivalent
seniority to such a member;
“the permitted period” means the period ending with the fifth working
day after the time mentioned in subsection (5)(b).
(8)
(1)
In a case where the selection of intercepted content for examination is
authorised by subsection (5), the person to whom the warrant is addressed
must notify the Secretary of State that the selection is being carried out.
Additional safeguards for items subject to legal privilege
Subsection (2) applies if, in a case where intercepted content obtained under a
bulk interception warrant is to be selected for examination—
(a) the selection of the intercepted content for examination meets any of
the selection conditions in section 134(3)(a) to (c), and
(b) either—
(i) the purpose, or one of the purposes, of using the criteria to be
used for the selection of the intercepted content for examination
(“the relevant criteria”) is to identify any items subject to legal
privilege, or
(ii) the use of the relevant criteria is likely to identify such items.
(2)
The intercepted content may be selected for examination using the relevant
criteria only if a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of State has
approved the use of those criteria.
(3)
A senior official may give an approval under subsection (2) only if—
(a) the official considers that the arrangements made for the purposes of
section 132 (safeguards relating to retention and disclosure of material)
include specific arrangements for the handling, retention, use and
destruction of items subject to legal privilege, and
(b) where subsection (1)(b)(i) applies, the official considers that there are
exceptional and compelling circumstances that make it necessary to
authorise the use of the relevant criteria.
(4)
(1)
(2)
Where an item subject to legal privilege intercepted in accordance with a bulk
interception warrant is retained following its examination, the person to whom
the warrant is addressed must inform the Investigatory Powers Commissioner
as soon as is reasonably practicable.
(For provision about the grounds for retaining material obtained under a
warrant, see section 132.)
(1)
Application of other restrictions in relation to warrants
Section 48 and Schedule 3 (exclusion of matters from legal proceedings) apply
in relation to bulk interception warrants as they apply in relation to targeted
interception warrants.
Sections 49 to 51 (duty not to make unauthorised disclosures) apply in relation
to bulk interception warrants as they apply in relation to targeted interception
warrants, but as if the reference in section 50(2)(c) to a requirement for
disclosure imposed by virtue of section 34(5) were a reference to such a
requirement imposed by virtue of section 131(4).

CHAPTER 2
BULK ACQUISITION WARRANTS
Bulk acquisition warrants
(1)
(2)
Power to issue bulk acquisition warrants
The Secretary of State may, on an application made by or on behalf of the head
of an intelligence service, issue a bulk acquisition warrant if—
(a) the Secretary of State considers that the warrant is necessary—
(i) in the interests of national security, or
(ii) on that ground and on any other grounds falling within
subsection (2),
(b) the Secretary of State considers that the conduct authorised by the
warrant is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that
conduct,
(c) the Secretary of State considers that—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 141) is a
purpose for which the examination of communications data
obtained under the warrant is or may be necessary, and
(ii) the examination of such data for each such purpose is necessary
on any of the grounds on which the Secretary of State considers
the warrant to be necessary,
(d) the Secretary of State considers that satisfactory arrangements made for
the purposes of section 150 (general safeguards) are in force in relation
to the warrant, and
(e) the decision to issue the warrant has been approved by a Judicial
Commissioner.
For the meaning of “head of an intelligence service”, see section 225.
A warrant is necessary on grounds falling within this subsection if it is
necessary—
(a) for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime, or
(b)
in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom so
far as those interests are also relevant to the interests of national
security (but see subsection (3)).
(3)
A warrant may be considered necessary on the ground falling within
subsection (2)(b) only if the communications data which it is considered
necessary to obtain is communications data relating to the acts or intentions of
persons outside the British Islands.
(4)
A warrant may not be considered necessary in the interests of national security
or on any other grounds falling within subsection (2) if it is considered
necessary only for the purpose of gathering evidence for use in any legal
proceedings.
(5)
The matters to be taken into account in considering whether the conditions in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) are met include whether the
communications data which it is thought necessary to obtain under the
warrant could reasonably be obtained by other means.
(6)
A bulk acquisition warrant is a warrant which authorises or requires the
person to whom it is addressed to secure, by any conduct described in the
warrant, any one or more of the activities in subsection (7).
(7)
The activities are—
(a) requiring a telecommunications operator specified in the warrant—
(i) to disclose to a person specified in the warrant any
communications data which is specified in the warrant and is in
the possession of the operator,
(ii) to obtain any communications data specified in the warrant
which is not in the possession of the operator but which the
operator is capable of obtaining, or
(iii) to disclose to a person specified in the warrant any data
obtained as mentioned in sub-paragraph (ii),
(b) the selection for examination, in any manner described in the warrant,
of communications data obtained under the warrant,
(c) the disclosure, in any manner described in the warrant, of such data to
the person to whom the warrant is addressed or to any person acting
on that person’s behalf.
(8)
A bulk acquisition warrant also authorises the following conduct (in addition
to the conduct described in the warrant)—
(a) any conduct which it is necessary to undertake in order to do what is
expressly authorised or required by the warrant, and
(b) conduct by any person which is conduct in pursuance of a requirement,
imposed by or on behalf of the person to whom the warrant is
addressed, to be provided with assistance in giving effect to the
warrant.
(9)
A bulk acquisition warrant may relate to data whether or not in existence at the
time of the issuing of the warrant.
(10)
An application for the issue of a bulk acquisition warrant may only be made on
behalf of the head of an intelligence service by a person holding office under
the Crown.
(1)
Approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners
In deciding whether to approve a decision to issue a warrant under section 138,
a Judicial Commissioner must review the Secretary of State’s conclusions as to
the following matters—
(a) whether the warrant is necessary as mentioned in subsection (1)(a) of
that section,
(b) whether the conduct that would be authorised by the warrant is
proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct, and
(c) whether—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 141) is a
purpose for which the examination of communications data
obtained under the warrant is or may be necessary, and
(ii) the examination of such data for each such purpose is necessary
as mentioned in section 138(1)(c)(ii).
(2)
In doing so, the Judicial Commissioner must apply the same principles as
would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review.
(3)
Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a decision to issue a
warrant under section 138, the Judicial Commissioner must give the Secretary
of State written reasons for the refusal.
(4)
Where a Judicial Commissioner, other than the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner, refuses to approve a decision to issue a warrant under section
decide whether to approve the decision to issue the warrant.
The decision to issue a bulk acquisition warrant must be taken personally by
the Secretary of State.

Requirements that must be met by warrants
(1)
A bulk acquisition warrant must contain a provision stating that it is a bulk
acquisition warrant.
(2)
A bulk acquisition warrant must be addressed to the head of the intelligence
service by whom, or on whose behalf, the application for the warrant was
made.
(3)
A bulk acquisition warrant must specify the operational purposes for which
any communications data obtained under the warrant may be selected for
examination.
(4)
In specifying any operational purposes, it is not sufficient simply to use the
descriptions contained in section 138(1)(a) or (2), but the purposes may still be
general purposes.
(5)
Decisions to issue warrants to be taken personally by Secretary of State
(1)
The warrant may, in particular, specify all of the operational purposes which,
at the time the warrant is issued, the person to whom it is addressed considers
are operational purposes for which communications data obtained under bulk
acquisition warrants may be selected for examination.
(6)
In this Chapter “the specified operational purposes”, in relation to bulk
acquisition warrants, means the operational purposes specified in the warrant
in accordance with this section.
Duration, modification and cancellation of warrants
(1)
(2)
Duration of warrants
A bulk acquisition warrant (unless already cancelled) ceases to have effect at
the end of the period of 6 months beginning with—
(a) the day on which the warrant was issued, or
(b) in the case of a warrant that has been renewed, the day after the day at
the end of which the warrant would have ceased to have effect if it had
not been renewed.
For provision about the renewal of warrants, see section 143.
Renewal of warrants
(1)
If the renewal conditions are met, a bulk acquisition warrant may be renewed,
at any time before it would otherwise cease to have effect, by an instrument
issued by the Secretary of State.
This is subject to subsection (5).
(2)
The renewal conditions are—
(a) that the Secretary of State considers that the warrant continues to be
necessary—
(i) in the interests of national security, or
(ii) on that ground and on any other grounds falling within section
(b) that the Secretary of State considers that the conduct that would be
authorised by the renewed warrant continues to be proportionate to
what is sought to be achieved by that conduct,
(c) that the Secretary of State considers that—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 141) is a
purpose for which the examination of communications data
obtained under the warrant continues to be, or may be,
necessary, and
(ii) the examination of such data for each such purpose continues to
be necessary on any of the grounds on which the Secretary of
State considers that the warrant continues to be necessary, and
(d) that the decision to renew the warrant has been approved by a Judicial
Commissioner.
(3)
The decision to renew a bulk acquisition warrant must be taken personally by
the Secretary of State and the instrument renewing the warrant must be signed
by the Secretary of State.
(4)
Section 139 (approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners) applies in
relation to a decision to renew a bulk acquisition warrant as it applies in
relation to a decision to issue a bulk acquisition warrant.
This is subject to subsection (5).
(5)
In the case of the renewal of a bulk acquisition warrant that has been modified
so that it no longer authorises or requires the carrying out of one or more
activities falling within section 138(7)(a)—
(a) the renewal condition in subsection (2)(a) is to be disregarded,
(b) the reference in subsection (2)(c)(ii) to the grounds on which the
Secretary of State considers the warrant to be necessary is to be read as
a reference to any grounds falling within section 138(1)(a) or (2), and
(c) section 139 has effect as if—
(i) paragraph (a) of subsection (1) were omitted, and
(ii) the reference in subsection (1)(c)(ii) to the grounds on which the
Secretary of State considers the warrant to be necessary were a
reference to any grounds falling within section 138(1)(a) or (2).
The provisions of a bulk acquisition warrant may be modified at any time by
an instrument issued by the person making the modification.
(2)
The only modifications that may be made under this section are—
(a) adding, varying or removing any operational purpose specified in the
warrant as a purpose for which any communications data obtained
under the warrant may be selected for examination, and
(b) providing that the warrant no longer authorises or requires the
carrying out of one or more activities falling within section 138(7)(a).
(4)
(5)
(6)
Modification of warrants
(1)
(3)
In this section—
(a) a modification adding or varying any operational purpose as
mentioned in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) is referred to as a “major
modification”, and
(b) any other modification within that subsection is referred to as a “minor
modification”.
A major modification—
(a) must be made by the Secretary of State, and
(b) may be made only if the Secretary of State considers that it is necessary
on any of the grounds on which the Secretary of State considers the
warrant to be necessary (see section 138(1)(a)).
Except where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent need to
make the modification, a major modification has effect only if the decision to
make the modification is approved by a Judicial Commissioner.
Section 139 (approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners) applies in
relation to a decision to make a major modification of a bulk acquisition
warrant as it applies in relation to the decision to issue a bulk acquisition
warrant.
Section 145 contains provision about the approval of major modifications made
in urgent cases.
(7)
A minor modification may be made by—
(a) the Secretary of State, or
(b) a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of State.
(8)
Where a minor modification is made by a senior official, the Secretary of State
must be notified personally of the modification and the reasons for making it.
(9)
If at any time a person mentioned in subsection (7) considers that any
operational purpose specified in a warrant is no longer a purpose for which the
examination of communications data obtained under the warrant is or may be
necessary, the person must modify the warrant by removing that operational
purpose.
(10)
The decision to modify the provisions of a warrant must be taken personally
by the person making the modification, and the instrument making the
modification must be signed by that person.
This is subject to subsection (11) (urgent cases).
(11)
In a case where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent need to
make a major modification—
(a) the instrument making the modification may be signed by a senior
official designated by the Secretary of State for that purpose, and
(b) the instrument must contain a statement that the case is an urgent case
in which the Secretary of State has personally and expressly authorised
the making of the modification.
(12)
(1)
Approval of major modifications made in urgent cases
This section applies where—
(a) the Secretary of State makes a major modification of a bulk acquisition
warrant without the approval of a Judicial Commissioner, and
(b) the Secretary of State considered that there was an urgent need to make
the modification.
The Secretary of State must inform a Judicial Commissioner that the
modification has been made.
(3)
The Judicial Commissioner must, before the end of the relevant period—
(a) decide whether to approve the decision to make the modification, and
(b) notify the Secretary of State of the Judicial Commissioner’s decision.
“The relevant period” means the period ending with the fifth working day after
the day on which the modification was made.
(5)
Nothing in this section applies in relation to modifying the provisions of a
warrant in a way which does not affect the conduct authorised or required by
it.
(2)
(4)
If the Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve the decision to make the
modification—
(a) the warrant (unless it no longer has effect) has effect as if the
modification had not been made, and
(b) the person to whom the warrant is addressed must, so far as is
reasonably practicable, secure that anything in the process of being
done under the warrant by virtue of that modification stops as soon as
possible.
Nothing in this section affects the lawfulness of—
(a) anything done under the warrant by virtue of the modification before
the modification ceases to have effect,
(b) if anything is in the process of being done under the warrant by virtue
of the modification when the modification ceases to have effect—
(i) anything done before that thing could be stopped, or
(ii)
anything done which it is not reasonably practicable to stop.
Cancellation of warrants
(1)
The Secretary of State, or a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of
State, may cancel a bulk acquisition warrant at any time.
(2)
If the Secretary of State, or a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of
State, considers that any of the cancellation conditions are met in relation to a
bulk acquisition warrant, the person must cancel the warrant.
(3)
The cancellation conditions are—
(a) that the warrant is no longer necessary in the interests of national
security,
(b) that the conduct authorised by the warrant is no longer proportionate
to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct,
(c) that the examination of communications data obtained under the
warrant is no longer necessary for any of the specified operational
purposes (see section 141).
(4)
But the condition in subsection (3)(a) does not apply where the warrant has
been modified so that it no longer authorises or requires the carrying out of one
or more activities falling within section 138(7)(a).
(5)
Where a warrant is cancelled under this section, the person to whom the
warrant was addressed must, so far as is reasonably practicable, secure that
anything in the process of being done under the warrant stops as soon as
possible.
(6)
A warrant that has been cancelled under this section may not be renewed.
Implementation of warrants

(2)
Implementation of warrants
In giving effect to a bulk acquisition warrant, the person to whom it is
addressed (“the implementing authority”) may (in addition to acting alone) act
through, or together with, such other persons as the implementing authority
may require (whether under subsection (2) or otherwise) to provide the
authority with assistance in giving effect to the warrant.
For the purpose of requiring any person to provide assistance in relation to a
bulk acquisition warrant, the implementing authority may—
(a) serve a copy of the warrant on any person whom the implementing

(4)
For the purposes of this Act, the provision of assistance in giving effect to a
bulk acquisition warrant includes any disclosure to the implementing
authority, or to persons acting on behalf of the implementing authority, of
communications data obtained under the warrant.
(5)
References in this section and in sections 148 and 149 to the service of a copy of
a warrant include—

(2)
A copy of a warrant may be served on the person in any of the following ways
(as well as by electronic or other means of service)—
(a) by serving it at the person’s principal office within the United Kingdom
or, if the person has no such office in the United Kingdom, at any place
in the United Kingdom where the person carries on business or
conducts activities;

which the person, or someone on the person’s behalf, will accept
service of documents of the same description as a copy of a warrant, by
serving it at that address;
(c) by making it available for inspection (whether to the person or to
someone acting on the person’s behalf) at a place in the United
Kingdom (but this is subject to subsection (3)).
(3)
A copy of a warrant may be served on a person in the way mentioned in

The steps mentioned in subsection (3)(b) must be taken as soon as reasonably
practicable after the copy of the warrant is made available for inspection.
(5)
In this section “the implementing authority” has the same meaning as in
section 147.
(1)
Duty of operators to assist with implementation
A telecommunications operator that has been served with a copy of a bulk
acquisition warrant by (or on behalf of) the implementing authority must take
all steps for giving effect to the warrant that are notified to the operator by (or
on behalf of) the implementing authority.
This is subject to subsection (3).
(2)
Subsection (1) applies whether or not the operator is in the United Kingdom.
(3)
The operator is not required to take any steps which it is not reasonably
practicable for the operator to take.
(4)
Where obligations have been imposed on a telecommunications operator (“P”)
under section 217 (maintenance of technical capability), for the purposes of
subsection (3) the steps which it is reasonably practicable for P to take include
every step which it would have been reasonably practicable for P to take if P
had complied with all of those obligations.
(5)
The duty imposed by subsection (1) is enforceable against a person in the
United Kingdom by civil proceedings by the Secretary of State for an
injunction, or for specific performance of a statutory duty under section 45 of
the Court of Session Act 1988, or for any other appropriate relief.

(a) that the requirements of subsections (2) and (5) are met in relation to the
communications data obtained under the warrant, and
(b) that the requirements of section 151 are met in relation to that data.
This is subject to subsection (8).
The requirements of this subsection are met in relation to the communications

minimum that is necessary for the authorised purposes (see subsection (3))—
(a) the number of persons to whom any of the data is disclosed or
otherwise made available,
(b) the extent to which any of the data is disclosed or otherwise made

The requirements of this subsection are met in relation to the communications
data obtained under a warrant if every copy made of any of that data (if not
destroyed earlier) is destroyed as soon there are no longer any relevant
grounds for retaining it (see subsection (6)).
For the purposes of subsection (5), there are no longer any relevant grounds for
retaining a copy of any data if, and only if—
(a) its retention is not necessary, or not likely to become necessary, in the
interests of national security or on any other grounds falling within

To the extent that the requirements of subsections (2) and (5) relate to any of
the data mentioned in subsection (7)(a), or to the copy mentioned in subsection
(7)(b), the arrangements made for the purposes of subsection (1) are not
required to secure that those requirements are met.
But the Secretary of State must instead ensure that arrangements are in force
for securing that communications data obtained under a bulk acquisition
warrant, or any copy of such data, is handed over or given to an overseas
authority only if the Secretary of State considers that requirements
corresponding to the requirements of subsections (2) and (5) will apply, to such
extent (if any) as the Secretary of State considers appropriate, in relation to
such data or copy.
In this section—
“copy”, in relation to communications data obtained under a warrant,
means any of the following (whether or not in documentary form)—

Bulk equipment interference warrants: general
For the purposes of this Act, a warrant is “bulk equipment interference
warrant” if—
(a) it is issued under this Chapter,
(b) it authorises or requires the person to whom it is addressed to secure
interference with any equipment for the purpose of obtaining—

or overseas-related information;
(b) it would or may assist in establishing the existence of overseas-related
communications or overseas-related information or in obtaining such
communications or information;

the obtaining of the communications, equipment data or other
information to which the warrant relates;
may also authorise or require the person to whom it is addressed to
secure—
(i) the selection for examination, in any manner described in the

warrant is addressed to be provided with assistance in giving effect to
the warrant.
A bulk equipment interference warrant may not, by virtue of subsection (4)(a),
authorise a person to engage in conduct, in relation to a communication other
than a stored communication, which would (unless done with lawful
authority) constitute an offence under section 2(1) (unlawful interception).

not be expressly authorised under the warrant because of the restriction
imposed by subsection (6).
(8)
In subsection (6), “stored communication” means a communication stored in or

necessary—
(a) for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime, or
(b) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom so
far as those interests are also relevant to the interests of national
security (but see subsection (3)).
A warrant may be considered necessary on the ground falling within
subsection (2)(b) only if the interference with equipment which would be
authorised by the warrant is considered necessary for the purpose of obtaining
information relating to the acts or intentions of persons outside the British
Islands.
(4)
The matters to be taken into account in considering whether the conditions in

purpose for which the examination of material obtained under
the warrant is or may be necessary, and
(ii) the examination of such material for each such purpose is
necessary as mentioned in section 156(1)(d)(ii).
(2)
In doing so, the Judicial Commissioner must apply the same principles as
would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review.
(3)
Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a decision to issue a
warrant under section 156, the Judicial Commissioner must give the Secretary
of State written reasons for the refusal.

anything in the process of being done under the warrant stops as soon
as possible;
(b) direct that any material obtained under the warrant is destroyed;
(c) impose conditions as to the use or retention of any of that material.

The Secretary of State may ask the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to
review a decision made by any other Judicial Commissioner under subsection
(3).
(7)
On a review under subsection (6), the Investigatory Powers Commissioner
may—
(a) confirm the Judicial Commissioner’s decision, or
(b) make a fresh determination.
(8)
Nothing in this section or section 158 affects the lawfulness of—
(a) anything done under the warrant before it ceases to have effect;
(b) if anything is in the process of being done under the warrant when it
ceases to have effect—
(i) anything done before that thing could be stopped, or
(ii) anything done that it is not reasonably practicable to stop.
Decisions to issue warrants to be taken personally by Secretary of State
(1)
The decision to issue a bulk equipment interference warrant must be taken
personally by the Secretary of State.
(2)
Before a bulk equipment interference warrant is issued, it must be signed by
the Secretary of State.
(3)
If it is not reasonably practicable for a warrant to be signed by the Secretary of
State, the warrant may be signed by a senior official designated by the
Secretary of State for that purpose.
(4)
In such a case, the warrant must contain a statement that—
(a) it is not reasonably practicable for the warrant to be signed by the
Secretary of State, and
(b)
the Secretary of State has personally and expressly authorised the issue
of the warrant.
Requirements that must be met by warrants
(1)
A bulk equipment interference warrant must contain a provision stating that it
is a bulk equipment interference warrant.
(2)
A bulk equipment interference warrant must be addressed to the head of the
intelligence service by whom, or on whose behalf, the application for the
warrant was made.
(3)
A bulk equipment interference warrant must describe the conduct that is
authorised by the warrant.
(4)
A bulk equipment interference warrant must specify the operational purposes
for which any material obtained under the warrant may be selected for
examination.
(5)
In specifying any operational purposes, it is not sufficient simply to use the
descriptions contained in section 156(1)(b) or (2), but the purposes may still be
general purposes.
(6)
The warrant may, in particular, specify all of the operational purposes which,
at the time the warrant is issued, the person to whom it is addressed considers
are operational purposes for which material obtained under bulk equipment
interference warrants may be selected for examination.
(7)
In this Chapter, “the specified operational purposes”, in relation to a bulk
equipment interference warrant, means the operational purposes specified in
the warrant in accordance with this section.
Duration, modification and cancellation of warrants
(1)
(2)
(3)
Duration of warrants
A bulk equipment interference warrant, ceases to have effect at the end of the
relevant period (see subsection (2)), unless—
(a) it is renewed before the end of that period (see section 163), or
(b) it is cancelled or otherwise ceases to have effect before the end of that
period (see sections 158 and 166).
In this section, “the relevant period”—
(a) in the case of an urgent warrant (see subsection (3)), means the period
ending with the fifth working day after the day on which the warrant
was issued;
(b) in any other case, means the period of 6 months beginning with—
(i) the day on which the warrant was issued, or
(ii) in the case of a warrant which has been renewed, the day after
the day at the end of which the warrant would have ceased to
have effect if it had not been renewed.
For the purposes of subsection (2)(a), a warrant is an “urgent warrant” if—
(a) the warrant was issued without the approval of a Judicial
Commissioner, and
(b)
the person who decided to issue the warrant considered that there was
an urgent need to issue it.
Renewal of warrants
(1)
If the renewal conditions are met, a bulk equipment interference warrant may
be renewed, at any time before the end of the relevant period, by an instrument
issued by the Secretary of State.
(2)
The renewal conditions are—
(a) that the Secretary of State considers that the warrant continues to be
necessary—
(i) in the interests of national security, or
(ii) on that ground and on any other grounds falling within section
(b) that the Secretary of State considers that the conduct that would be
authorised by the renewed warrant continues to be proportionate to
what is sought to be achieved by that conduct,
(c) that the Secretary of State considers that—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 161) is a
purpose for which the examination of material obtained under
the warrant continues to be or may be necessary, and
(ii) the examination of such material for each such purpose
continues to be necessary on any of the grounds on which the
Secretary of State considers that the warrant continues to be
necessary, and
(d) that the decision to renew the warrant has been approved by a Judicial
Commissioner.
(3)
The decision to renew a bulk equipment interference warrant must be taken
personally by the Secretary of State, and the instrument renewing the warrant
must be signed by the Secretary of State.
(4)
Section 157 (approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners) applies in
relation to a decision to renew a bulk equipment interference warrant as it
applies in relation to a decision to issue a bulk equipment interference warrant.
(5)
In the case of a bulk equipment interference warrant which has been modified
so that it no longer authorises or requires the securing of interference with any
equipment or the obtaining of any communications, equipment data or other
information—
(a) the renewal condition in subsection (2)(a) is to be disregarded,
(b) the reference in subsection (2)(c)(ii) to the grounds on which the
Secretary of State considers the warrant to be necessary is to be read as
a reference to any grounds falling within section 156(1)(b) or (2), and
(c) section 157 has effect as if—
(i) paragraph (a) of subsection (1) were omitted, and
(ii) the reference in subsection (1)(c)(ii) to the grounds on which the
Secretary of State considers the warrant to be necessary were a
reference to any grounds falling within section 156(1)(b) or (2).
Modification of warrants
(1)
The provisions of a bulk equipment interference warrant may be modified at
any time by an instrument issued by the person making the modification.
(2)
The modifications which may be made under this section are—
(a) adding, varying or removing any operational purpose specified in the
warrant as a purpose for which any material obtained under the
warrant may be selected for examination, and
(b) adding, varying or removing any description of conduct authorised by
the warrant.
(3)
(4)
In this section—
(a) a modification adding or varying any operational purpose, or any
description of conduct, as mentioned in subsection (2) is referred to as
a “major modification”, and
(b) any other modification within that subsection is referred to as a “minor
modification”.
A major modification—
(a) must be made by the Secretary of State, and
(b) may be made only if the Secretary of State considers that it is necessary
on any of the grounds on which the Secretary of State considers the
warrant to be necessary (see section 156(1)(b)).
(5)
Except where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent need to
make the modification, a major modification has effect only if the decision to
make the modification is approved by a Judicial Commissioner.
(6)
Section 157 (approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners) applies in
relation to a decision to make a major modification of a bulk equipment
interference warrant as it applies in relation to the decision to issue a bulk
equipment interference warrant.
Section 165 contains provision about the approval of major modifications made
in urgent cases.
(7)
A minor modification may be made by—
(a) the Secretary of State, or
(b) a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of State.
(8)
Where a minor modification is made by a senior official, the Secretary of State
must be notified personally of the modification and the reasons for making it.
(9)
If at any time a person mentioned in subsection (7) considers that any
operational purpose specified in a warrant is no longer a purpose for which the
examination of material obtained under the warrant is or may be necessary, the
person must modify the warrant by removing that operational purpose.
(10)
The decision to modify the provisions of a warrant must be taken personally
by the person making the modification, and the instrument making the
modification must be signed by that person.
This is subject to subsection (11) (urgent cases).
(11)
In a case where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent need to
make a major modification—
(a) the instrument making the modification may be signed by a senior
official designated by the Secretary of State for that purpose, and
(b)
the instrument must contain a statement that the case is an urgent case
in which the Secretary of State has personally and expressly authorised
the making of the modification.
(12)
Despite section 154(1)(a) and (4)(b), the modification of a bulk equipment
interference warrant so that it no longer authorises or requires the securing of
interference with any equipment or the obtaining of any communications,
equipment data or other information does not prevent the warrant from being
regarded as a bulk equipment interference warrant.
(13)
Nothing in this section applies in relation to modifying the provisions of a
warrant in a way which does not affect the conduct authorised by it.
(1)
Approval of major modifications made in urgent cases
This section applies where—
(a) the Secretary of State makes a major modification of a bulk equipment
interference warrant without the approval of a Judicial Commissioner,
and
(b) the Secretary of State considered that there was an urgent need to make
the modification.
(2)
The Secretary of State must inform a Judicial Commissioner that the
modification has been made.
(3)
The Judicial Commissioner must, before the end of the relevant period—
(a) decide whether to approve the decision to make the modification, and
(b) notify the Secretary of State of the Judicial Commissioner’s decision.
“The relevant period” means the period ending with the fifth working day after
the day on which the modification was made.
(4)
If the Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve the decision to make the
modification—
(a) the warrant (unless it no longer has effect) has effect as if the
modification had not been made, and
(b) the person to whom the warrant is addressed must, so far as is
reasonably practicable, secure that anything in the process of being
done under the warrant by virtue of that modification stops as soon as
possible.
(5)
(6)
The Judicial Commissioner may authorise further interference with equipment
for the purpose of enabling the person to whom the warrant is addressed to
secure that anything in the process of being done under the warrant by virtue
of the modification stops as soon as possible.
Nothing in this section affects the lawfulness of—
(a) anything done under the warrant by virtue of the modification before
the modification ceases to have effect;
(b) if anything is in the process of being done under the warrant by virtue
of the modification when the modification ceases to have effect—
(i) anything done before that thing could be stopped, or
(ii) anything done which it is not reasonably practicable to stop.
Cancellation of warrants
(1)
The Secretary of State, or a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of
State, may cancel a bulk equipment interference warrant at any time.
(2)
If the Secretary of State, or a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of
State, considers that any of the cancellation conditions are met in relation to a
bulk equipment interference warrant, the person must cancel the warrant.
(3)
The cancellation conditions are—
(a) that the warrant is no longer necessary in the interests of national
security;
(b) that the conduct authorised by the warrant is no longer proportionate
to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct;
(c) that the examination of material obtained under the warrant is no
longer necessary for any of the specified operational purposes (see
section 161).
(4)
But the condition in subsection (3)(a) does not apply where the warrant has
been modified so that it no longer authorises or requires the securing of
interference with any equipment or the obtaining of any communications,
equipment data or other information.
(5)
Where a warrant is cancelled under this section, the person to whom the
warrant was addressed must, so far as is reasonably practicable, secure that
anything in the process of being done under the warrant stops as soon as
possible.
(6)
A warrant that has been cancelled under this section may not be renewed.
Implementation of warrants
(1)
(2)
Implementation of warrants
In giving effect to a bulk equipment interference warrant, the person to whom
it is addressed (“the implementing authority”) may (in addition to acting
alone) act through, or together with, such other persons as the implementing
authority may require (whether under subsection (2) or otherwise) to provide
the authority with assistance in giving effect to the warrant.
For the purpose of requiring any person to provide assistance in relation to a
bulk equipment interference warrant, the implementing authority may—
(a) serve a copy of the warrant on any person who the implementing
authority considers may be able to provide such assistance, or
(b) make arrangements for the service of a copy of the warrant on any such
person.
(3)
A copy of a warrant may be served under subsection (2) on a person outside
the United Kingdom for the purpose of requiring the person to provide such
assistance in the form of conduct outside the United Kingdom.
(4)
For the purposes of this Act, the provision of assistance in giving effect to a
bulk equipment interference warrant includes any disclosure to the
implementing authority, or to persons acting on behalf of the implementing
authority, of material obtained under the warrant.
(5)
(6)
Sections 110 (service of warrants outside the United Kingdom) and 111 (duty
of telecommunications operators to assist with implementation) apply in
relation to a bulk equipment interference warrant as they apply in relation to a
targeted equipment interference warrant issued under section 91 by the
Secretary of State.
References in this section (and in sections 110 and 111 as they apply in relation
to bulk equipment interference warrants) to the service of a copy of a warrant
include—
(a) the service of a copy of one or more schedules contained in the warrant
with the omission of the remainder of the warrant, and
(b) the service of a copy of the warrant with the omission of any schedule
contained in the warrant.
Restrictions on use or disclosure of material obtained under warrants etc.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
Safeguards relating to retention and disclosure of material
The Secretary of State must ensure, in relation to every bulk equipment
interference warrant, that arrangements are in force for securing—
(a) that the requirements of subsections (2) and (5) are met in relation to the
material obtained under the warrant, and
(b) that the requirements of section 170 are met in relation to that material.
This is subject to subsection (8).
The requirements of this subsection are met in relation to the material obtained
under the warrant if each of the following is limited to the minimum that is
necessary for the authorised purposes (see subsection (3))—
(a) the number of persons to whom any of the material is disclosed or
otherwise made available;
(b) the extent to which any of the material is disclosed or otherwise made
available;
(c) the extent to which any of the material is copied;
(d) the number of copies that are made.
For the purposes of subsection (2) something is necessary for the authorised
purposes if, and only if—
(a) it is, or is likely to become, necessary in the interests of national security
or on any other grounds falling within section 156(2),
(b) it is necessary for facilitating the carrying out of any functions under
this Act of the Secretary of State, the Scottish Ministers or the head of
the intelligence service to whom the warrant is or was addressed,
(c) it is necessary for facilitating the carrying out of any functions of the
Judicial Commissioners or of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal under
or in relation to this Act,
(d) it is necessary for the purpose of legal proceedings, or
(e) it is necessary for the performance of the functions of any person by or
under any enactment.
The arrangements for the time being in force under this section for securing
that the requirements of subsection (2) are met in relation to the material
obtained under the warrant must include arrangements for securing that every
copy made of any of that material is stored, for so long as it is retained, in a
secure manner.
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)
The requirements of this subsection are met in relation to the material obtained
under the warrant if every copy made of any of that material (if not destroyed
earlier) is destroyed as soon as there are no longer any relevant grounds for
retaining it (see subsection (6)).
For the purposes of subsection (5), there are no longer any relevant grounds for
retaining a copy of any material if, and only if—
(a) its retention is not necessary, or not likely to become necessary, in the
interests of national security or on any other grounds falling within
section 156(2), and
(b) its retention is not necessary for any of the purposes mentioned in
paragraphs (b) to (e) of subsection (3) above.
Subsection (8) applies if—
(a) any material obtained under the warrant has been handed over to any
overseas authorities, or
(b) a copy of any such material has been given to any overseas authorities.
To the extent that the requirements of subsections (2) and (5) relate to any of
the material mentioned in subsection (7)(a), or to the copy mentioned in
subsection (7)(b), the arrangements made for the purpose of this section are not
required to secure that those requirements are met (see instead section 169).
In this section—
“copy”, in relation to any material obtained under a warrant, means any
of the following (whether or not in documentary form)—
(a) any copy, extract or summary of the material which identifies
the material as having been obtained under the warrant, and
(b) any record which is a record of the identities of persons who
owned, used or were in possession of the equipment which was
interfered with to obtain that material,
and “copied” is to be read accordingly;
“overseas authorities” means authorities of a country or territory outside
the United Kingdom.
Safeguards relating to disclosure of material or data overseas
(1)
The Secretary of State must ensure, in relation to every bulk equipment
interference warrant, that arrangements are in force for securing that—
(a) any material obtained under the warrant is handed over to overseas
authorities only if the requirements of subsection (2) are met, and
(b) copies of any such material are given to overseas authorities only if
those requirements are met.
(2)
The requirements of this subsection are met in the case of a warrant if it appears
to the Secretary of State that requirements corresponding to the requirements
of section 168(2) and (5) (“the relevant requirements”) will apply, to such extent
(if any) as the Secretary of State considers appropriate, in relation to any of the
material which is handed over, or any copy of which is given, to the authorities
in question.
(3)
In this section—
“copy” has the same meaning as in section 168;
“overseas authorities” means authorities of a country or territory outside
the United Kingdom.
(1)
Safeguards relating to examination of material etc.
For the purposes of section 168, the requirements of this section are met in
relation to the material obtained under a warrant if—
(a) any selection of the material obtained under the warrant is carried out
only for the specified purposes (see subsection (2)),
(b) the selection of any of the material for examination is necessary and
proportionate in all the circumstances, and
(c) where any such material is protected material, the selection of the
material for examination meets any of the selection conditions (see
subsection (3)).
(2)
The selection of material obtained under the warrant is carried out only for the
specified purposes if the material is selected for examination only so far as is
necessary for the operational purposes specified in the warrant in accordance
with section 161.
In this subsection “specified in the warrant” means specified in the warrant at
the time of the selection of the material for examination.
(3)
The selection conditions referred to in subsection (1)(c) are—
(a) that the selection of the protected material for examination does not
breach the prohibition in subsection (4);
(b) that the person to whom the warrant is addressed reasonably considers
that the selection of the protected material for examination would not
breach that prohibition;
(c) that the selection of the protected material for examination in breach of
that prohibition is authorised by subsection (5);
(d) that the selection of the protected material for examination in breach of
that prohibition is authorised by a targeted examination warrant issued
under Part 5.
(4)
(5)
The prohibition referred to in subsection (3)(a) is that the protected material
may not at any time be selected for examination if—
(a) any criteria used for the selection of the material for examination are
referable to an individual known to be in the British Islands at that time,
and
(b) the purpose of using those criteria is to identify protected material
consisting of communications sent by, or intended for, that individual
or private information relating to that individual.
It does not matter for the purposes of this subsection whether the identity of
the individual is known.
The selection of protected material (“the relevant material”) for examination is
authorised by this subsection if—
(a) criteria referable to an individual have been, or are being, used for the
selection of material for examination in circumstances falling within
subsection (3)(a) or (b),
(b) at any time it appears to the person to whom the warrant is addressed
that there has been a relevant change of circumstances in relation to the
individual (see subsection (6)) which would mean that the selection of
(c)
(d)
(6)
(7)
the relevant material for examination would breach the prohibition in
subsection (4),
since that time, a written authorisation to examine the relevant material
using those criteria has been given by a senior officer, and
the selection of the relevant material for examination is made before the
end of the permitted period (see subsection (7)).
For the purposes of subsection (5)(b) there is a relevant change of
circumstances in relation to an individual if—
(a) the individual has entered the British Islands, or
(b) a belief by the person to whom the warrant is addressed that the
individual was outside the British Islands was in fact mistaken.
In subsection (5)—
“senior officer”, in relation to a warrant addressed to the head of an
intelligence service, means a member of the intelligence service who—
(a) is a member of the Senior Civil Service or a member of the
Senior Management Structure of Her Majesty’s Diplomatic
Service, or
(b) holds a position in the intelligence service of equivalent
seniority to such a member;
“the permitted period” means the period ending with the fifth working
day after the time permitted in subsection (5)(b).
(8)
In a case where the selection of protected material for examination is
authorised by subsection (5), the person to whom the warrant is addressed
must notify the Secretary of State that the selection is being carried out.
(9)
In this section, “protected material” means any material obtained under the
warrant other than material which is—
(a) equipment data;
(b) information (other than a communication or equipment data) which is
not private information.
(1)
Additional safeguards for items subject to legal privilege
Subsection (2) applies if, in a case where protected material obtained under a
bulk equipment interference warrant is to be selected for examination—
(a) the selection of the material for examination meets any of the selection
conditions in section 170(3)(a) to (c), and
(b) either—
(i) the purpose, or one of the purposes, of using the criteria to be
used for the selection of the material for examination (“the
relevant criteria”) is to identify any items subject to legal
privilege, or
(ii) the use of the relevant criteria is likely to identify such items.
(2)
The material may be selected for examination using the relevant criteria only if
a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of State has approved the use
of those criteria.
(3)
A senior official may give an approval under subsection (2) only if—
(a) the official considers that the arrangements made for the purposes of
section 168 (safeguards relating to retention and disclosure of material)
(b)
(4)
include specific arrangements for the handling, retention, use and
destruction of items subject to legal privilege, and
where subsection (1)(b)(i) applies, the official considers that there are
exceptional and compelling circumstances that make it necessary to
authorise the use of the relevant criteria.
Where an item subject to legal privilege is retained following its examination
under a bulk equipment interference warrant, the person to whom the warrant
is addressed must inform the Investigatory Powers Commissioner as soon as
is reasonably practicable.
(For provision about the grounds for retaining material obtained under a bulk
equipment interference warrant, see section 168.)
Application of other restrictions in relation to warrants
Sections 114 to 116 (duty not to make unauthorised disclosures) apply in
relation to bulk equipment interference warrants as they apply in relation to
targeted equipment interference warrants, but as if the reference in section
were a reference to such a requirement imposed by virtue of section 167(4).

PART 7
BULK PERSONAL DATASET WARRANTS
Bulk personal datasets: interpretation
(1)
(2)
Bulk personal datasets: interpretation
For the purposes of this Part, an intelligence service retains a bulk personal
dataset if—
(a) the intelligence service obtains a set of information that includes
personal data relating to a number of individuals,
(b) the nature of the set is such that the majority of the individuals are not,
and are unlikely to become, of interest to the intelligence service in the
exercise of its functions,
(c) after any initial examination of the contents, the intelligence service
retains the set for the purpose of the exercise of its functions, and
(d) the set is held, or is to be held, electronically for analysis in the exercise
of those functions.
An intelligence service may not exercise a power to retain a bulk personal
dataset unless the retention of the dataset is authorised by a warrant under this
Part.
(2)
An intelligence service may not exercise a power to examine a bulk personal
dataset retained by it unless the examination is authorised by a warrant under
this Part.
(3)
For the purposes of this Part, there are two kinds of warrant—
(a) a warrant, referred to in this Part as “a class BPD warrant”, authorising
an intelligence service to retain, or to retain and examine, any bulk
personal dataset of a class described in the warrant;
(b) a warrant, referred to in this Part as “a specific BPD warrant”,
authorising an intelligence service to retain, or to retain and examine,
any bulk personal dataset described in the warrant.
(1)
Requirement for authorisation by warrant: general
(1)
(4)
In this section, “personal data” has the same meaning as in the Data Protection
Act 1998 except that it also includes data relating to a deceased individual
where the data would be personal data within the meaning of that Act if it
related to a living individual.
Requirement for warrant
Section 176 sets out exceptions to the restrictions imposed by subsections (1) to
(3) of this section.
Exceptions to section 175(1) and (2)
Section 175(1) or (2) does not apply to the exercise of a power of an intelligence
service to retain or (as the case may be) examine a bulk personal dataset if the
intelligence service obtained the bulk personal dataset under a warrant or
other authorisation issued or given under this Act.
(2)
Section 175(1) or (2) does not apply at any time when a bulk personal dataset
is being retained or (as the case may be) examined for the purpose of enabling
any of the information contained in it to be destroyed.
(3)
Sections 189(7) and 190(5) provide for other exceptions to section 175(1) or (2)
(in connection with the non-renewal or cancellation of BPD warrants and
initial examinations).
Issue of warrants
Class BPD warrants
(1)
The head of an intelligence service, or a person acting on his or her behalf, may
apply to the Secretary of State for a class BPD warrant.
(2)
The application must include—
(a) a description of the class of bulk personal datasets to which the
application relates, and
(b) in a case where the intelligence service wishes to examine bulk personal
datasets of that class, the operational purposes for which the
intelligence service wishes to do so.
(3)
(4)
The Secretary of State may issue the warrant if—
(a) the Secretary of State considers that the warrant is necessary—
(i) in the interests of national security,
(ii) for the purposes of preventing or detecting serious crime, or
(iii) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United
Kingdom so far as those interests are also relevant to the
interests of national security,
(b) the Secretary of State considers that the conduct authorised by the
warrant is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by the
conduct,
(c) where the warrant authorises the examination of bulk personal datasets
of the class described in the warrant, the Secretary of State considers
that—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 183) is a
purpose for which the examination of bulk personal datasets of
that class is or may be necessary, and
(ii) the examination of bulk personal datasets of that class for each
such purpose is necessary on any of the grounds on which the
Secretary of State considers the warrant to be necessary,
(d) the Secretary of State considers that the arrangements made by the
intelligence service for storing bulk personal datasets of the class to
which the application relates and for protecting them from
unauthorised disclosure are satisfactory, and
(e) the decision to issue the warrant has been approved by a Judicial
Commissioner.
An application for a class BPD warrant may only be made on behalf of the head
of an intelligence service by a person holding office under the Crown.
Specific BPD warrants
(1)
The head of an intelligence service, or a person acting on his or her behalf, may
apply to the Secretary of State for a specific BPD warrant in the following cases.
(2)
Case 1 is where—

personal dataset, and
(b) the bulk personal dataset does not fall within a class described in a class
BPD warrant.
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
Case 2 is where—
(a) the intelligence service wishes to retain, or to retain and examine, a bulk
personal dataset, and
(b) the bulk personal dataset falls within a class described in a class BPD
warrant but the intelligence service at any time considers that it would
be appropriate to seek a specific BPD warrant.
The application must include—
(a) a description of the bulk personal dataset to which the application
relates, and
(b) in a case where the intelligence service wishes to examine the bulk
personal dataset, the operational purposes for which the intelligence
service wishes to do so.
The Secretary of State may issue the warrant if—
(a) the Secretary of State considers that the warrant is necessary—
(i) in the interests of national security,
(ii) for the purposes of preventing or detecting serious crime, or
(iii) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United
Kingdom so far as those interests are also relevant to the
interests of national security,
(b) the Secretary of State considers that the conduct authorised by the
warrant is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by the
conduct,
(c) where the warrant authorises the examination of a bulk personal
dataset, the Secretary of State considers that—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 183) is a
purpose for which the examination of the bulk personal dataset
is or may be necessary, and
(ii) the examination of the bulk personal dataset for each such
purpose is necessary on any of the grounds on which the
Secretary of State considers the warrant to be necessary,
(d) the Secretary of State considers that the arrangements made by the
intelligence service for storing the bulk personal dataset and for
protecting it from unauthorised disclosure are satisfactory, and
(e) except where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent
need to issue the warrant, the decision to issue it has been approved by
a Judicial Commissioner.
A specific BPD warrant relating to a bulk personal dataset (“dataset A”) may
also authorise the retention or examination of other bulk personal datasets
(“replacement datasets”) that do not exist at the time of the issue of the warrant
but may reasonably be regarded as replacements for dataset A.
(7)
(1)
An application for a specific BPD warrant may only be made on behalf of the
head of an intelligence service by a person holding office under the Crown.
Approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners
In deciding whether to approve a decision to issue a class BPD warrant or a
specific BPD warrant, a Judicial Commissioner must review the Secretary of
State’s conclusions on the following matters—
(a) whether the warrant is necessary on grounds falling within section
(b) whether the conduct that would be authorised by the warrant is
proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct, and
(c) where the warrant authorises examination of bulk personal datasets of
a class described in the warrant or (as the case may be) of a bulk
personal dataset described in the warrant, whether—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 183) is a
purpose for which the examination of bulk personal datasets of
that class or (as the case may be) the bulk personal dataset is or
may be necessary, and
(ii) the examination of bulk personal datasets of that class or (as the
case may be) the bulk personal dataset is necessary as
mentioned in section 177(3)(c)(ii) or (as the case may be) section
(2)
In doing so, the Judicial Commissioner must apply the same principles as
would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review.
(3)
Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a decision to issue a class
BPD warrant or a specific BPD warrant, the Judicial Commissioner must give
the Secretary of State written reasons for the refusal.
(4)
Where a Judicial Commissioner, other than the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner, refuses to approve a decision to issue a class BPD warrant or a
specific BPD warrant, the Secretary of State may ask the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner to decide whether to approve the decision to issue the warrant.
(1)

This section applies where—
(a) a specific BPD warrant is issued without the approval of a Judicial
Commissioner, and
(b) the Secretary of State believed that there was an urgent need to issue it.
(2)
The Secretary of State must inform a Judicial Commissioner that it has been
issued.
(3)
The Judicial Commissioner must, before the end of the relevant period—

“The relevant period” means the period ending with the third working day
after the day on which the warrant was issued.
(4)
If a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve the decision to issue a specific
BPD warrant, the warrant—
(a) ceases to have effect (unless already cancelled), and
(b)
(5)
may not be renewed.
Section 181 contains further provision about what happens if a Judicial
Commissioner refuses to approve a decision to issue a warrant.

so far as is reasonably practicable, secure that anything in the process of being
done in reliance on the warrant stops as soon as possible.
(3)
The Judicial Commissioner may—
(a) direct that the whole or part of a bulk personal dataset retained in
reliance on the warrant is destroyed;
(b) impose conditions as to the use or retention of the whole or part of any
such bulk personal dataset.
(4)
The Judicial Commissioner—
(a) may require an affected party to make representations about how the
Judicial Commissioner should exercise any function under subsection
(3), and
(b) must have regard to any such representations made by an affected
party (whether or not as a result of a requirement imposed under
paragraph (a)).
(5)
Each of the following is an “affected party” for the purposes of subsection (4)—
(a) the Secretary of State;
(b) the head of the intelligence service to whom the warrant was
addressed.
(6)

may—
(a) confirm the Judicial Commissioner’s decision, or
(b) make a fresh determination.
(8)
Nothing in this section or section 180 affects the lawfulness of—
(a) anything done in reliance on the warrant before it ceases to have effect;
(b) if anything is in the process of being done in reliance on the warrant
when it ceases to have effect—
(i) anything done before that thing could be stopped, or
(ii) anything done that it is not reasonably practicable to stop.
Decisions to issue warrants to be taken personally by Secretary of State
(1)
The decision to issue a class BPD warrant or a specific BPD warrant must be
taken personally by the Secretary of State.
(2)
Before a class BPD warrant is issued, it must be signed by the Secretary of State.
(3)
Before a specific BPD warrant is issued, it must be signed by the Secretary of
State (subject to subsection (4)).
(4)
If it is not reasonably practicable for a specific BPD warrant to be signed by the
Secretary of State, it may be signed by a senior official designated by the
Secretary of State for that purpose.
In such a case, the warrant must contain a statement that—
(a) it is not reasonably practicable for the warrant to be signed by the
Secretary of State, and
(b) the Secretary of State has personally and expressly authorised the issue
of the warrant.
(5)
Requirements that must be met by warrants
(1)
A class BPD warrant or a specific BPD warrant must contain a provision stating
whether it is a class BPD warrant or (as the case may be) a specific BPD
warrant.
(2)
A class BPD warrant or a specific BPD warrant must be addressed to the head
of the intelligence service by whom, or on whose behalf, the application for the
warrant was made.
(3)
A class BPD warrant must—
(a) include a description of the class of bulk personal datasets to which the
warrant relates, and
(b) where the warrant authorises examination of bulk personal datasets of
that class, specify the operational purposes for which data contained in
bulk personal datasets of that class may be selected for examination.
(4)
(5)
(6)
A specific BPD warrant must—
(a) describe the bulk personal dataset to which the warrant relates,
(b) where the warrant authorises the retention or examination of
replacement datasets, include a description that will enable those
datasets to be identified, and
(c) where the warrant authorises the examination of the bulk personal
dataset or replacement datasets, specify the operational purposes for
which data contained in the bulk personal dataset and any replacement
datasets may be selected for examination.
In specifying any operational purposes, it is not sufficient simply to use the
descriptions contained in section 177(3)(a) or (as the case may be) section
A class BPD warrant or a specific BPD warrant may, in particular, specify all of
the operational purposes which, at the time the warrant is issued, the person to
whom it is addressed considers are operational purposes for which data
contained in bulk personal datasets of the class described in the warrant, or (as
the case may be) data contained in the bulk personal dataset and any
replacement datasets described in the warrant, may be selected for
examination.
Duration, modification and cancellation
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
Duration of warrants
A class BPD warrant or a specific BPD warrant ceases to have effect at the end
of the relevant period (see subsection (2)) unless—
(a) it is renewed before the end of that period (see section 185), or
(b) it is cancelled or (in the case of a specific BPD warrant) otherwise ceases
to have effect before the end of that period (see sections 180 and 188).
In this section, “the relevant period”—
(a) in the case of an urgent specific BPD warrant (see subsection (3)), means
the period ending with the fifth working day after the day on which the
warrant was issued;
(b) in any other case, means the period of 6 months beginning with—
(i) the day on which the warrant was issued, or
(ii) in the case of a warrant that has been renewed, the day after the
day at the end of which the warrant would have ceased to have
effect if it had not been renewed.
For the purposes of subsection (2)(a), a specific BPD warrant is an “urgent
specific BPD warrant” if—
(a) the warrant was issued without the approval of a Judicial
Commissioner, and
(b) the Secretary of State considered that there was an urgent need to issue
it.
For provision about the renewal of warrants, see section 185.
Renewal of warrants
(1)
If the renewal conditions are met, a class BPD warrant or a specific BPD
warrant may be renewed, at any time before the end of the relevant period, by
an instrument issued by the Secretary of State.
(2)
The renewal conditions are—
(a) that the Secretary of State considers that the warrant continues to be
necessary on grounds falling within section 177(3)(a) or (as the case
may be) section 178(5)(a),
(b) that the Secretary of State considers that the conduct that would be
authorised by the renewed warrant continues to be proportionate to
what is sought to be achieved by the conduct,
(c) where the warrant authorises examination of bulk personal datasets of
a class described in the warrant or (as the case may be) of a bulk
personal dataset described in the warrant, that the Secretary of State
considers that—
(i) each of the specified operational purposes (see section 183) is a
purpose for which the examination of bulk personal datasets of
that class or (as the case may be) the bulk personal dataset
continues to be, or may be, necessary, and
(ii) the examination of bulk personal datasets of that class or (as the
case may be) the bulk personal dataset continues to be
necessary on any of the grounds on which the Secretary of State
considers that the warrant continues to be necessary, and
(d)
(3)
(4)
that the decision to renew the warrant has been approved by a Judicial
Commissioner.
The decision to renew a class BPD warrant or a specific BPD warrant must be
taken personally by the Secretary of State, and the instrument renewing the

warrant to be necessary (see section 177(3)(a) or (as the case may be)
section 178(5)(a)).
(5)
Except where the Secretary of State considers that there is an urgent need to
make the modification, a major modification has effect only if the decision to
make the modification is approved by a Judicial Commissioner.
(6)
Section 179 (approval of warrants by Judicial Commissioners) applies in
relation to a decision to make a major modification of a class BPD warrant or a
specific BPD warrant as it applies in relation to the decision to issue such a
warrant.
Section 187 contains provision about the approval of major modifications made
in urgent cases.
(7)

may be necessary, the person must modify the warrant by removing that
operational purpose.
(10)
The decision to modify the provisions of a class BPD warrant or a specific BPD
warrant must be taken personally by the person making the modification, and

Commissioner, and
(b) the Secretary of State considered that there was an urgent need to make
the modification.
(2)
The Secretary of State must inform a Judicial Commissioner that the
modification has been made.
(3)
The Judicial Commissioner must, before the end of the relevant period—
(a) decide whether to approve the decision to make the modification, and
(b) notify the Secretary of State of the Judicial Commissioner’s decision.
“The relevant period” means the period ending with the fifth working day after
the day on which the modification was made.
(4)
(5)
If the Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve the decision to make the
modification—
(a) the warrant (unless it no longer has effect) has effect as if the
modification had not been made, and
(b) the person to whom the warrant is addressed must, so far as is
reasonably practicable, secure that anything in the process of being
done in reliance on the warrant by virtue of that modification stops as
soon as possible.
Nothing in this section affects the lawfulness of—
(a) anything done in reliance on the warrant by virtue of the modification
before the modification ceases to have effect;
(b) if anything is in the process of being done in reliance on the warrant by
virtue of the modification when the modification ceases to have effect—
(i) anything done before that thing could be stopped, or
(ii) anything done which it is not reasonably practicable to stop.
Cancellation of warrants
(1)
The Secretary of State, or a senior official acting on behalf of the Secretary of
State, may cancel a class BPD warrant or a specific BPD warrant at any time.

retention and examination, of the whole or any part of the
material retained by the intelligence service in reliance on the
warrant which has ceased to have effect;
(ii) a class BPD warrant authorising the retention or (as the case
may be) the retention and examination of bulk personal
datasets of a class that is described in a way that would
authorise the retention or (as the case may be) the retention and

not exceed 3 months.
(4)
Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a decision by the Secretary
of State to authorise the retention or (as the case may be) the retention and
examination of any material under subsection (3)(b), the Judicial
Commissioner must give the Secretary of State written reasons for the decision.
(5)
Where a Judicial Commissioner, other than the Investigatory Powers

for the warrant.
Further and supplementary provision
(1)
Initial examinations: time limits
This section applies where—
(a) an intelligence service obtains a set of information otherwise than in the
exercise of a power conferred by a warrant or other authorisation
issued or given under this Act, and
(b) the head of the intelligence service believes that—
(i)
(ii)
(2)
the set includes, or may include, personal data relating to a
number of individuals, and
the nature of the set is, or may be, such that the majority of the
individuals are not, and are unlikely to become, of interest to
the intelligence service in the exercise of its functions.
The head of the intelligence service must take the following steps before the
end of the permitted period.
Step 1
Carry out an initial examination of the set for the purpose of deciding whether,
if the intelligence service were to retain it after that initial examination and
hold it electronically for analysis for the purposes of the exercise of its
functions, the intelligence service would be retaining a bulk personal dataset
(see section 174).
Step 2
If the intelligence service would be retaining a bulk personal dataset as
mentioned in step 1, decide whether to retain the set and hold it electronically
for analysis the purposes of the exercise of the functions of the intelligence
service.
Step 3
If the head of the intelligence service decides to retain the set and hold it
electronically for analysis as mentioned in step 2, apply for a specific BPD
warrant as soon as reasonably practicable after making that decision (unless
the retention of the dataset is authorised by a class BPD warrant).
(3)
The permitted period begins when the head of the intelligence service first
forms the beliefs mentioned in subsection (1)(b).
(4)
The permitted period ends—
(a) where the set of information was created in the United Kingdom, 3
months after the day on which it begins;
(b) where the set of information was created outside the United Kingdom,
(5)
(1)
If the head of the intelligence service applies for a specific BPD warrant in
accordance with step 3 (set out in subsection (2))—
(a) the intelligence service is not to be regarded as in breach of section
between the taking of the decision mentioned in step 2 and the
determination of the application for the specific BPD warrant, and
(b) the intelligence service is not to be regarded as in breach of section
period if the examination is necessary for the purposes of the making of
the application for the warrant.
Safeguards relating to examination of bulk personal datasets
The Secretary of State must ensure, in relation to every class BPD warrant or
specific BPD warrant which authorises examination of bulk personal datasets
of a class described in the warrant or (as the case may be) of a bulk personal
dataset described in the warrant, that—
(a)
(b)
any selection of data contained in the datasets (or dataset) for
examination is carried out only for the specified purposes (see
subsection (2)), and
the selection of any such data for examination is necessary and
proportionate in all the circumstances.
(2)
The selection of data contained in bulk personal datasets for examination is
carried out only for the specified purposes if the data is selected for
examination only so far as is necessary for the operational purposes specified
in the warrant in accordance with section 183.
(3)
In subsection (2) “specified in the warrant” means specified in the warrant at
the time of the selection of the data for examination.
(1)
Application of Part to bulk personal datasets obtained under this Act
Subject to subsection (2), this section applies where a bulk personal dataset has
been obtained by an intelligence service under a warrant or other authorisation
issued or given under this Act (and, accordingly, section 175(1) and (2) do not
apply by virtue of section 176(1)).
(2)
This section does not apply where the bulk personal dataset was obtained by
the intelligence service under a bulk acquisition warrant issued under Chapter
(3)
Where this section applies, the Secretary of State may, on the application of the
head of the intelligence service, give a direction that—
(a) the intelligence service may retain, or retain and examine, the bulk
personal dataset by virtue of the direction,
(b) any other power of the intelligence service to retain or examine the bulk
personal dataset, and any associated regulatory provision, ceases to
apply in relation to the bulk personal dataset (subject to subsection (5)),
and
(c) section 176(1) also ceases to apply in relation to the bulk personal
dataset.
(4)
Accordingly, where a direction is given under subsection (3), the intelligence
service may exercise its power by virtue of the direction to retain, or to retain
and examine, the bulk personal dataset only if authorised to do so by a class
BPD warrant or a specific BPD warrant under this Part.
(5)
A direction under subsection (3) may provide for any associated regulatory
provision specified in the direction to continue to apply in relation to the bulk
personal dataset, with or without modifications specified in the direction.
(6)
The power conferred by subsection (5) must be exercised to ensure that, where
section 48 and Schedule 3 applied in relation to the bulk personal dataset
immediately before the giving of the direction, they continue to apply in
relation to it (without modification).
(7)
The Secretary of State may only give a direction under subsection (3) with the
approval of a Judicial Commissioner.
(8)
Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a decision by the Secretary
of State to give a direction under subsection (3), the Judicial Commissioner
must give the Secretary of State written reasons for the decision.
(9)
Where a Judicial Commissioner, other than the Investigatory Powers
Commissioner, refuses to approve such a decision, the Secretary of State may
ask the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to decide whether to approve the
decision.
(10)
A direction under subsection (3)—
(a) may not be revoked;
(b) may be varied but only for the purpose of altering or removing any
provision included in the direction under subsection (5).
(11)
The head of an intelligence service may, at the same time as applying for a
direction under subsection (3), apply for a specific BPD warrant under section
giving the direction).
(12)
In this section, “associated regulatory provision”, in relation to a power of an
intelligence service to retain or examine a bulk personal dataset, means any
provision which—
(a) is made by or for the purposes of this Act (other than this Part), and
(b) applied in relation to the retention, examination, disclosure or other use
of the bulk personal dataset immediately before the giving of a
direction under subsection (3).
(2)
